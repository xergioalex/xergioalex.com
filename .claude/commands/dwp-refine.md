### Step 0: Determine Target Type

**Parse parameters to determine if working with draft or plan:**

```
/dwp-refine                      → Interactive: ask draft or plan
/dwp-refine latest               → Draft: most recent draft
/dwp-refine {filename}           → Draft: specific file
/dwp-refine plan latest          → Plan: most recent plan
/dwp-refine plan {name}          → Plan: specific plan
```

## Important Notes

- **Preserve completed work:** When modifying plans, never alter `[x]` completed tasks unless explicitly requested
- **Renumber carefully:** When adding/removing tasks, update all task file numbers and README references
- **Maintain consistency:** Ensure task files follow the standard format
- **Git ignore:** Files in `drafts/` and `plans/` are git-ignored (except README.md and .gitkeep)
- **Backup suggestion:** For major changes, consider creating a copy first
