## Running Claude Code with Full Permissions

### Option 1: CLI Flag (Recommended)

Execute Claude Code from the command line with all permissions enabled using the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag:

```bash
# Interactive mode with all permissions
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# With initial query
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "refactor the authentication module"

# Print mode (non-interactive) with all permissions
claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions "review this code"
```

**⚠️ Security Note:** This flag bypasses all permission prompts. Use with caution, especially in shared environments.

### Option 2: Allowed Tools Flag

For more granular control, use `--allowedTools` to specify which tools can run without prompting:

```bash
# Allow all common development tools
claude --allowedTools "Bash(*),WebFetch(*),WebSearch,FileRead(*),FileWrite(*),FileDelete(*),Git(*),Npm(*),Node(*),TypeScript(*),ESLint(*),Prettier(*),Mocha(*),Serverless(*),Docker(*),AWS(*)" "your query here"
```

### Option 3: Settings File

The `settings.local.json` file in this directory is already configured with broad permissions. When you run Claude Code normally, it will use these settings:

```bash
# Normal execution (uses settings.local.json permissions)
claude "your query here"
```

**Current settings:** The `settings.local.json` file includes wildcard permissions for:
- All Bash commands (`Bash(*)`)
- All web operations (`WebFetch(*)`, `WebSearch`)
- All file operations (`FileRead(*)`, `FileWrite(*)`, `FileDelete(*)`)
- All development tools (`Git(*)`, `Npm(*)`, `Node(*)`, etc.)

### Quick Reference

| Method | Command | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Skip all prompts** | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` | Maximum automation, no interruptions |
| **Specific tools** | `claude --allowedTools "Bash(*),Git(*)"` | Fine-grained control |
| **Settings file** | `claude` (normal) | Persistent configuration |

## Available Commands

### Deep Work Plans

Commands for managing long-duration, multi-task execution plans.

#### `/dwp-create` ⭐ Main Command
Create a complete deep work plan with unified flow (info → draft → refine → final).

**Usage:**
```
/dwp-create [name] [trust|auto]
```

**Modes:**

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 Guided | `/dwp-create` | Full flow with review step before final plan |
| 🎯 Guided + Name | `/dwp-create my_plan` | Same, with plan name pre-filled |
| 🚀 Trust | `/dwp-create trust` | Full flow, no confirmations |
| 🚀 Trust + Name | `/dwp-create my_plan trust` | Fastest path |
| 📝 Draft only | `/dwp-create draft my_plan` | Only creates draft + refined draft |
| 📁 From draft | `/dwp-create from PLAN_x.md` | Creates final from existing draft |

**Unified Flow (Guided Mode):**
1. You provide: name, objective, context, tasks
2. Agent creates: draft → refined draft automatically
3. You review: the refined plan summary
4. You approve: agent creates final executable plan
5. Agent asks: execute now? → starts execution if yes

**Unified Flow (Trust Mode):**
1. You provide: name, objective, context, tasks
2. Agent creates: draft → refined draft → final plan (no stops)
3. Agent asks: execute now? → starts execution if yes

**Examples:**

```bash
# Fastest: provide name, trust mode
/dwp-create auth_refactor trust
# → Answer questions → Plan created automatically

# Interactive with review
/dwp-create
# → Answer questions → Review refined plan → Approve → Plan created

# Named plan with review
/dwp-create stripe_integration
# → Answer questions → Review → Approve → Plan created

# From existing draft
/dwp-create from PLAN_auth_refactor_draft_refined.md
# → Creates final plan directly
```

**Output:**
- Drafts: `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/drafts/`

## Command Workflow Examples

### Creating and Executing a Plan

**🚀 Fastest Path (Trust Mode + Execute):**
```bash
# One command does everything: draft → refine → final plan → execute
/dwp-create my_project_plan trust

# Agent asks for: objective, context, tasks
# Then automatically creates: draft → refined draft → final plan
# Agent asks: "Execute now?" → you say yes → execution starts

# That's it! One command, answer questions, plan executes.
```

**🎯 Guided Mode (With Review):**
```bash
# Start the unified flow
/dwp-create

# Agent asks for: name, objective, context, tasks
# Creates draft and refined draft automatically
# Shows summary for your review
# You approve → final plan created
# Agent asks: "Execute now?" → you decide

# Full control with smooth flow.
```

**📝 Just Want a Draft:**
```bash
# Create only draft + refined draft (no final plan)
/dwp-create draft my_project_plan

# Later, create final plan from it
/dwp-create from PLAN_my_project_plan_draft_refined.md
```

**Comparison - Old vs New Flow:**
```
OLD (3+ commands):
  /dwp-create draft → /dwp-refine → /dwp-create from-draft → /dwp-execute

NEW (1-2 commands):
  /dwp-create [trust] → /dwp-execute
```

### Resuming After Interruption

**Fast mode:**
```bash
# Check status first
/dwp-status my_project_plan
# → See current progress

# Resume execution
/dwp-resume my_project_plan
# → Continues from where it left off
```

**Interactive mode:**
```bash
# Check status first
/dwp-status
# → Select plan
# → See current progress

# Resume execution
/dwp-resume
# → Select plan
# → Continues from where it left off
```

### Upgrading Libraries

**Interactive mode (recommended):**
```bash
# Execute with auto-discovery
/lib-upgrade
# → Automatically runs `ncu`
# → Shows categorized report:
#    📦 Package Update Report
#    Patch upgrades (safest): 2
#    Minor upgrades (safe): 5
#    Major upgrades (⚠️ breaking): 1
# → Presents menu:
#    1. Upgrade patch versions only
#    2. Upgrade patch + minor (recommended)
#    3. Upgrade all (minor first, then ask about major)
#    4. Select specific packages
#    5. Cancel
# → Select option (e.g., "2" for patch + minor)
# → Runs `ncu -u --target minor && npm install`
# → Validates with codecheck
# → After minor complete, asks about major upgrades
# → Generates comprehensive report
```

**Example flow:**
```
You: /lib-upgrade

Agent: Running ncu to discover packages...

📦 Package Update Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Patch upgrades (safest): 2
  • axios: 1.6.0 → 1.6.2

## Important Notes

### Git Ignore
- Files in `drafts/` and `plans/` folders are **git-ignored** (except README.md and .gitkeep)
- These are temporary execution artifacts, not permanent repository content

### Naming Conventions
- Plan names: `snake_case`, lowercase (e.g., `refactor_auth`, not `RefactorAuth`)
- Draft files: `PLAN_{name}_draft.md` or `PLAN_{name}_draft_refined.md`
- Plan folders: `PLAN_{name}/`

### Execution Rules
- Plans execute tasks **strictly in order**
- **One task at a time** - never skip or reorder
- **Validation required** - never mark complete without passing validations
- **Commit after each task** - small, incremental commits
