## What to do

Route this invocation to the **verify** sub-skill of the installed `deepworkplan`
skill and follow it: read `.agents/skills/deepworkplan/verify/SKILL.md` and
execute its flow. It runs read-only and produces an objective pass/fail
conformance report against the DeepWorkPlan specification (the artifacts a repo
MUST/SHOULD have and whether plans in `.dwp/plans/` are well-formed).

> Other agents: invoke the skill's `deepworkplan-verify` sub-skill directly
> (`/deepworkplan-verify` in Claude Code, `#deepworkplan-verify` elsewhere). This
> `dwp-verify` file is the shorter, conventional alias.
