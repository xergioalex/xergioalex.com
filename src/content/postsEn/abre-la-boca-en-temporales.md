title: "“Abre la boca” in Temporales"
description: "Non-fiction text (or essay?, or story?) written after reading Clarice Lispector and published in the magazine Temporales (from the MFA in Creative Writing in Spanish at NYU). “I only came to do this experiment for one reason: it's because I read that story, I'm talking about «The Egg and the Chicken», just so you know; but I read it wrong. What a sadness”."
