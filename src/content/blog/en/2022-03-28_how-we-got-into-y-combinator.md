I gave a talk in an **entrepreneurship class at Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (UTP)** about how we got into Y Combinator. I wanted to tell my full story as an entrepreneur: the evolution, the products we built at [Rocka.co](https://rocka.co), constant experimentation, the failures — and how DailyBot was born in an internal Hackathon and finally found success.

## Rocka.co: Experiment and Build

At Rocka we built many products. We experimented a lot. Some of the projects that passed through our hands: [Bootstrup.com](https://bootstrup.com), [Club Kechef](https://clubkechef.com), [Lanzador](https://lanzador.co), [Neurocicla](https://neurocicla.com), [Moli Market](https://molimarket.com), [KidTrix](https://kidtrix.com), [Bambú Meditación](https://appbambu.com). Each one was a bet, an iteration, a learning.

I also participated in communities like **PereiraJS**, **Pereira Tech Talks**, and **Python Pereira** — spaces where ecosystem is built and knowledge is shared.

## The Internal Hackathon and DailyBot

DailyBot wasn't born from a master plan. It was born in an **internal Hackathon** at Rocka. The idea: an AI assistant for work automation — **in-chat automation for work**. We built it, we tested it, and this time it stuck. After many attempts, DailyBot became the product that found traction.

## We Applied 3 Times to Y Combinator

We didn't get in on the first try. **We applied 3 times**. Each application was an iteration: better pitch, better product, better understanding of what YC was looking for. In 2022 DailyBot was recognized as one of [Y Combinator's Top Companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/dailybot).

---

## What I Shared in the Talk

At UTP I talked about the process: how we prepared the pitch, what we learned with each application, and why persistence — along with a product that solves a real problem — ends up opening doors. Work automation in chat (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.) was a space we were exploring and that YC saw potential in.
