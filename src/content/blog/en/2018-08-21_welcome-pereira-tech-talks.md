In August 2018 we launched **Pereira Tech Talks** — a community meetup for developers in Pereira and the coffee region. I gave the welcome talk, introducing what we were building: a space for tech talks, NodeSchool workshops, and networking. The goal was simple: bring people together, share knowledge, and grow the local tech scene.

The slides covered our vision: **TECH TALKS**, **NODE SCHOOL**, **NETWORKING**, and a call for collaborators and speakers. We wanted to make it clear that this was a community effort — we were looking for people to join, present, and help shape what came next.

## What We Offered

- **Tech Talks** — Regular meetups with talks on a wide range of topics: from blockchain to Vue.js, from Docker to serverless.
- **NodeSchool** — Hands-on workshops for learning Node.js (we later ran [NodeSchool Day Pereira](https://xergioalex.com/blog/nodeschool-day-pereira/) in June 2018).
- **Networking** — A space to meet other developers, share experiences, and build connections.

## Community Guidelines

We established simple norms: don't interrupt, raise your hand to participate. Small things, but they set the tone for respectful, inclusive conversations.
