In July 2018 I gave an intro to Go at Pereira Tech Talks. Go had been on my radar for a while — it was designed for modern systems that need high performance and concurrency, and the standard library made it easy to build web servers, work with databases, and handle encoding without pulling in a ton of dependencies.

**What is Go?** Open source, compiled, cross-platform. C-like syntax with the ergonomics of an interpreted language. Created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson — the same Ken Thompson behind B, C, and UNIX. Released as open source in 2009, version 1.0 in 2012.

## Why Go?

- **Easy to learn** — The language is small and consistent.
- **Modern** — Designed for high performance and high concurrency.
- **Standard library** — `net/http`, `database/sql`, `encoding`, `testing`, encryption — you get a lot out of the box.
- **Gopher pet** — The mascot is cute. That counts.

## What I Covered

- **Basics** — Hello World, variables, types, functions, loops, conditionals, switch
- **Data structures** — Arrays, maps, structs, methods, interfaces
- **Concurrency** — Goroutines, channels, defer, panic/errors, pointers
- **Practical examples** — HTTP server, HTTP client, file I/O
- **Frameworks** — Revel, Beego, Gin, Buffalo
- **Bonus** — WebAssembly, Ebiten (2D games)
