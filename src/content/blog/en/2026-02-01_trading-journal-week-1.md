This is the first entry in my trading journal. I've decided to document my journey through the financial markets — the wins, the losses, and everything I learn along the way. Writing things down forces me to think clearly about what I'm doing and why. It's the same principle I use when reviewing code or planning architecture: if you can't explain it, you don't understand it well enough.

## Why Trading? Why Now?

I've spent years building software products — systems that need to be precise, logical, testable. Trading felt like a completely different world when I first looked at it. But the more I learned, the more I saw patterns. Risk management. Probability. System design. Decision-making under uncertainty. These aren't foreign concepts to engineers — we deal with them every day. The difference is that in trading, the feedback loop is instant and unforgiving.

I'm drawn to that. I like systems where performance is measurable, where you can improve through iteration, where discipline and process matter more than gut instinct. Trading is exactly that — if you approach it the right way.

## Setting Up the Workspace

The first step was getting my environment ready. I spent the better part of Monday configuring my charting platform (TradingView), setting up watchlists for the currency pairs I want to focus on (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY to start), and organizing my trading plan template in Notion.

I've learned from software development that a clean, distraction-free workspace matters. My setup now: two monitors — one for charts, one for notes and research. No social media open. No distractions. Just price action, my journal, and a cup of coffee.

I also set up a spreadsheet to track every trade I'll eventually take — entry price, exit price, position size, risk-reward ratio, and a notes column for my thought process. I'm treating this like a software log. The goal is to build a dataset I can analyze later to find patterns in my own behavior.

## Choosing Learning Resources

There's no shortage of trading courses, books, and YouTube channels. Most of it is noise. I wanted signal. After some research, I settled on a few core resources:

- **Mark Douglas — Trading in the Zone** — The psychology book everyone recommends. It's about mindset, discipline, and managing emotions. Haven't finished it yet, but it's already shifting how I think about risk.
- **ICT (Inner Circle Trader)** — Focuses on market structure, liquidity, and institutional order flow. His free YouTube content is dense but good. I'm taking notes on key concepts like order blocks, fair value gaps, and liquidity grabs.
- **Babypips** — A beginner-friendly resource for the fundamentals. I'm using it to fill gaps in my understanding of forex mechanics, pips, lot sizes, spreads.

I'm trying to avoid the trap of endlessly consuming content and never practicing. The plan: spend 30% of my time learning, 70% observing and eventually trading.

## First Observations

Watching the markets for the first time with real intention (not just curiosity) is a different experience. Price doesn't move randomly — you start to see how news events, session opens (London, New York), and liquidity zones create patterns.

I spent most of the week in observation mode. No trades. Just watching, taking notes, trying to understand the rhythm. I focused on the daily and 4-hour charts — longer timeframes where the noise is filtered out.

One thing I noticed: price tends to respect certain levels. Support and resistance aren't just lines on a chart — they represent zones where institutions accumulate or distribute. When price approaches these areas, it either bounces or breaks through with momentum. I'm starting to see why traders say "the chart tells a story."

## The Hardest Part So Far

Patience. Every candle feels like it's telling you to do something. The temptation to jump in, to test an idea, to *feel* like you're making progress by taking action — it's strong. Especially as an engineer. I'm used to building, shipping, iterating fast.

Trading punishes that instinct. Rushing in without a plan, without a clear setup, without proper risk management — that's how accounts blow up. I've read enough stories to know that. So this week was about learning to sit still. To watch. To wait for clarity.

It's uncomfortable. But I'm treating it as practice.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Preparation matters more than action.** The hours spent setting up systems, choosing resources, and building a journal will pay off in discipline later. Just like in software: good architecture prevents bugs.
2. **Observation is underrated.** You don't need to trade every day. In fact, the best traders spend most of their time waiting. Watching the market teaches you more than jumping in blindly.
3. **Journaling is non-negotiable.** Writing forces clarity. If I can't explain why I would take a trade, I shouldn't take it. This is my version of code review for trading.

## Goals for Next Week

- Identify 2-3 high-probability setups that align with my trading plan (focusing on daily and 4-hour timeframes)
- Practice marking key levels on the charts — support, resistance, order blocks, liquidity zones
- Continue journaling every session, even if I don't trade
- Read more of *Trading in the Zone* — specifically the chapters on probability and accepting risk

Let's keep learning.
