This is the first entry in my trading journal. I've decided to document my journey through the financial markets — the wins, the losses, and everything I learn along the way. Writing things down forces me to think clearly about what I'm doing and why.

## Setting Up

The first step was getting my workspace ready. I spent time configuring my charting platform, setting up watchlists for the currency pairs I want to focus on, and organizing my trading plan template. Having a clean, distraction-free setup is more important than I initially thought.

I also set up a spreadsheet to track every trade — entry, exit, position size, risk-reward ratio, and notes about my thought process. The goal is to build a dataset I can analyze later to find patterns in my own behavior.

## First Observations

Watching the markets for the first time with real intention (not just curiosity) is a different experience. Price doesn't move randomly — you start to see how news events, session opens, and liquidity zones create patterns. I spent most of the week in observation mode, not placing any trades. Just watching, taking notes, and trying to understand the rhythm.

The hardest part so far? Patience. Every candle feels like it's telling you to do something. Learning to sit still and wait for a clear setup is going to be one of my biggest challenges.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Preparation matters more than action.** The hours spent setting up systems and processes will pay off in discipline later.
2. **Observation is underrated.** You don't need to trade every day. Watching the market teaches you more than jumping in blindly.
3. **Journaling is non-negotiable.** Writing forces clarity. If I can't explain why I would take a trade, I shouldn't take it.

## Goals for Next Week

- Identify 2-3 setups that align with my trading plan
- Practice marking key levels on the daily and 4-hour charts
- Continue journaling every session, even if I don't trade
