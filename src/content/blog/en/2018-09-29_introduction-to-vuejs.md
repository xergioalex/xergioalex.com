I gave an introduction to Vue.js at [Pereira Tech Talks](https://www.pereiratechtalks.com/). Vue had been gaining traction and I wanted to share why I like it so much: it's approachable, well-documented, and feels natural to work with. The talk focused on the concepts that make Vue special.

## Progressive Framework

Vue is a **progressive framework**: simple things stay simple, complex things are possible. You can drop it into an existing project with a simple `<script>` tag, or build a full application with Vue CLI. That flexibility is one of the things I value most: it doesn't force you to adopt everything at once.

## Core Concepts

- **MV\*** — Vue follows the Model-View pattern, with clear separation of concerns.
- **Reactive** — The DOM updates automatically when your data changes. No manual DOM manipulation.
- **Virtual DOM** — Vue uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates, similar to React. The core is UI-oriented.
- **Components** — Everything is built from reusable, composable components.

## Why Vue?

- **Easy and fun to learn** — The docs are excellent and the syntax feels intuitive.
- **SPA** — Vue Router and Vuex make building single-page apps straightforward. The "holy trinity" of Vue: the core, the router, and state management.
- **Performance** — Competitive with other frameworks in benchmarks.
