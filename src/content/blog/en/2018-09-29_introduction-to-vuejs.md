In September 2018 I gave an intro to Vue.js at Pereira Tech Talks. Vue had been gaining traction — it was approachable, well-documented, and felt natural to work with. The talk focused on why Vue stands out: progressive adoption, reactivity, and a gentle learning curve.

Vue is a **progressive framework**: simple things stay simple, complex things are possible. You can drop it into an existing project with a script tag, or build a full SPA with the Vue CLI. That flexibility was one of the things I wanted to highlight.

## Core Concepts

- **MV\*** — Vue follows the Model-View pattern, with clear separation of concerns.
- **Reactive** — The DOM updates automatically when your data changes. No manual DOM manipulation.
- **Virtual DOM** — Vue uses a virtual DOM for efficient updates, similar to React.
- **Components** — Everything is built from reusable, composable components.
- **UI-oriented** — The core library focuses on the view layer; routing and state management are separate.

## Why Vue?

- **Easy and fun to learn** — The docs are excellent, and the syntax feels intuitive.
- **Performance** — Competitive with other frameworks in benchmarks.
- **SPA support** — Vue Router and Vuex (now Pinia) make building single-page apps straightforward.
