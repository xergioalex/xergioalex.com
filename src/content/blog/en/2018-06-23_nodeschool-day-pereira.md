On Saturday, June 23, 2018, we held NodeSchool Day Pereira, driven by the [PereiraJs](https://pereira.js.org/) community. It was a great turnout — 35 spots, with a significant portion reserved for women to help close the gender gap in tech. I gave the welcome talk and shared my [Learn You Node solutions](https://github.com/xergioalex/learnyounode-solutions) for anyone who wanted to check their work.

[NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/) is a global community that runs free, open workshops in over 200 cities. The format is hands-on: you work through exercises at your own pace, with mentors available to help. In Pereira we had two tracks: **Learn You Node** (Node.js fundamentals) and **Creating P2P networks in Node.js** (with [Manuel Pineda](https://twitter.com/pin3da)'s workshop).
