This was the **first meetup of Pereira Tech Talks** — the community was just getting started. We had two talks: Manuel Pineda on AirFlow (workflow orchestration), and me on TensorFlow. It was a milestone for the local tech community.

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is Google's open-source machine learning library. Google uses it across its infrastructure, and it's designed for building models with neural networks using a data-flow description language. In my talk I covered how it works, the story behind it, and the basics of getting started.

## What I Covered

- **The story behind TensorFlow** — Why Google open-sourced it and how it fits into the AI landscape
- **Core concepts** — Data flow graphs, tensors, and the programming model
- **Building neural networks** — From simple examples to understanding the framework
- **Getting started** — Installation, first steps, and resources for learning more
