Blockchain as a technology beyond Bitcoin — focusing on **applications**: why blockchain has been called the industrial revolution of the internet and what possibilities it opens beyond cryptocurrencies.

---

## The Context: Trust and Decentralization

I started by framing the problem. Trust is the pillar of every digital and commercial relationship. Today we operate under a **centralized trust model**: banks, notaries, platforms — intermediaries that assume risk and reputation. The 2008 crisis from corruption in financial systems exposed the weaknesses of that model.

In 2009 emerged a movement concerned with privacy that worked on systems based on cryptography. From there came the idea: a **distributed network of trust** for the exchange of goods and services **without intermediaries**.

## What Blockchain Is

Blockchain combines three elements:

- **Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks** — Nodes that communicate with each other
- **Cryptography** — Digital signatures, hashing, verification
- **Block-based storage system** — A chain of blocks where each contains transactions and a reference to the previous one

With Bitcoin, a transaction is a transfer of value between addresses: origin, digital signature, amount, destination. The blockchain maintains consensus on who has what. But the same concept applies beyond money: you can transfer a house, a title, a certificate — any data that requires an immutable, verifiable record.

## Ethereum and Smart Contracts

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is a blockchain with an integrated programming language for creating **smart contracts**. Vitalik Buterin said that *"Bitcoin is excellent as digital money, but its scripting language is too weak to build advanced applications seriously."*

Smart contracts permit transactions of value in a transparent, secure, and **100% automatable** way. The transfer logic is programmable. [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) is the object-oriented language for writing these contracts — influenced by JavaScript.

## DAPPs: Decentralized Applications

**DAPPs** (Decentralized Apps) are applications that operate autonomously, without an entity controlling their tokens. Data is stored on a public, decentralized blockchain. They use a cryptographic token for access and reward miners who contribute value.

In the talk I showed examples of applications beyond Bitcoin: supply chains, identity, voting, provenance — use cases where decentralized trust and immutability change the rules of the game.
