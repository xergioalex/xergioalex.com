That night we had two talks on Bitcoin and blockchain. [Carlos Mesa](https://twitter.com/MonoMesa) from the Bitcoin Colombia Foundation opened with the basics: what Bitcoin is, how it works, its history, and the technology behind it. I followed with a talk focused on **blockchain as a technology beyond cryptocurrencies** — why it's often called the industrial revolution of the internet.

Blockchain is the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But beyond FinTech, we're seeing the birth of a technology with huge potential to transform how we coordinate, reduce administrative costs, enable cross-sector cooperation, and unlock possibilities that the "information internet" couldn't deliver on its own.

## Beyond Bitcoin: What Blockchain Enables

- **Decentralized trust** — No single authority controls the ledger. Consensus replaces intermediaries.
- **Transparency and immutability** — Records are append-only and verifiable by anyone.
- **Smart contracts** — Self-executing agreements (Ethereum, Solidity) that run without a middleman.
- **New coordination models** — Supply chains, identity, voting, provenance — use cases beyond money.

The goal of my talk was to show that blockchain isn't just "crypto" — it's a new layer for how we build trust and coordinate at scale.
