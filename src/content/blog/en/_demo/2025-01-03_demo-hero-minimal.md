Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are practices that automate the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications. When implemented well, they transform how teams deliver software — from manual, error-prone releases to automated, reliable pipelines.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests verify each change. The goal is to detect integration problems early, when they're cheap to fix.

A typical CI workflow looks like this:

1. Developer pushes code to a feature branch
2. CI server detects the change and starts a pipeline
3. Code is compiled and linted
4. Unit tests and integration tests run
5. Code coverage reports are generated
6. Results are reported back to the pull request

### Example: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run type-check
      - run: npm test -- --coverage

      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD extends CI by automatically deploying every change that passes the pipeline to a target environment. There are two flavors:

- **Continuous Delivery:** Changes are automatically prepared for release but require manual approval for production deployment
- **Continuous Deployment:** Every passing change goes directly to production without manual intervention

### Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Risk Level | Rollback Speed |
|----------|-------------|:----------:|:--------------:|
| Rolling | Gradually replaces old instances | Low | Medium |
| Blue-Green | Switches traffic between two environments | Low | Fast |
| Canary | Routes a small percentage of traffic to new version | Very Low | Fast |
| Recreate | Stops old version, starts new version | High | Slow |

## Pipeline Best Practices

**Keep pipelines fast.** Slow pipelines kill productivity. Aim for under 10 minutes for CI and use parallelism where possible.

**Fail fast.** Run the cheapest checks first (linting, type checking) before expensive ones (integration tests, E2E tests).

**Make pipelines deterministic.** Use locked dependency versions, pinned Docker images, and avoid reliance on external services that might be flaky.

**Use environments wisely.** A typical progression looks like:

```
feature branch → staging → production
     (CI)          (CD)       (CD)
```

## Monitoring and Observability

A pipeline doesn't end at deployment. Post-deployment monitoring is essential:

- **Health checks** verify the application is responding correctly
- **Error rate monitoring** catches regressions the test suite missed
- **Performance metrics** ensure deployments don't introduce latency
- **Automatic rollback** triggers when health checks fail

## Getting Started

You don't need a complex setup to start. Begin with a simple CI pipeline that runs your tests on every push. As your confidence grows, add linting, security scanning, and automated deployments. The best pipeline is the one your team actually uses and trusts.
