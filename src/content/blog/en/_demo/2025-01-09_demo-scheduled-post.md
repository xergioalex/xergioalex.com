This is a **scheduled post** demo. It has a `pubDate` set far in the future (2030-06-15 at 2:00 PM), so it won't appear in production until a site rebuild happens after that date and time.

## How Scheduling Works

Scheduled posts have a future `pubDate` and `draft: false` (or no draft field). They are:

- **Hidden** from production builds because `pubDate > now`
- **Visible** in dev mode with a **blue "Scheduled" badge** showing the publication date
- Automatically published when the site is rebuilt after the `pubDate` has passed

## The Content

In a real scenario, this would be a complete article ready to go live. The author has finished writing it but wants it published on a specific date — perhaps to coincide with an event, a launch, or a content calendar.

> Scheduled posts are great for planning content ahead of time. Write it when you're inspired, publish it when the timing is right.

## Preview

Notice the blue badge in the blog listing that shows the scheduled date. In the detail view, there's a prominent banner at the top indicating this is a scheduled post.
