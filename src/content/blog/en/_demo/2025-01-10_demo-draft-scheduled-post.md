This is a **draft + scheduled** post demo. It combines both states: `draft: true` AND a future `pubDate`. This is the most restrictive visibility state.

## Double Protection

Draft + scheduled posts are:

- **Hidden** from production for two reasons: the draft flag AND the future date
- **Visible** in dev mode with **both badges** — amber "Draft" and blue "Scheduled"
- The draft must be set to `false` AND the `pubDate` must pass before the post becomes visible

## Use Case

This state is ideal for content that is:

1. **Not yet finished** (draft) — still needs editing, review, or more sections
2. **Planned for a future date** (scheduled) — tied to an event or release

Think of it as "I know when I want to publish this, but I'm not done writing it yet."

> The two badges stack side by side in the listing view, giving you a clear visual signal that this post needs both completion and time before going live.
