Writing code is easy. Writing code that another developer (or your future self) can understand six months later — that's the real challenge. Clean code isn't about following rigid rules; it's about empathy for the reader.

## What Makes Code "Clean"?

Robert C. Martin, in his influential book *Clean Code*, defines it simply: "Clean code reads like well-written prose." But beyond readability, clean code has several characteristics:

- **Intentional:** Every line has a clear purpose
- **Minimal:** No duplication, no dead code, no unnecessary complexity
- **Tested:** Behavior is verified by automated tests
- **Honest:** The code does what it appears to do — no hidden side effects

## Naming Things

Phil Karlton famously said there are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things. Good names make code self-documenting:

```typescript
// Bad: What does this do?
const d = new Date();
const x = d.getTime() - u.t;
if (x > 86400000) { /* ... */ }

// Good: The intent is clear
const now = new Date();
const timeSinceLastLogin = now.getTime() - user.lastLoginTimestamp;
const ONE_DAY_MS = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
if (timeSinceLastLogin > ONE_DAY_MS) { /* ... */ }
```

A good variable name answers three questions: *what is it*, *why does it exist*, and *how is it used*. If you need a comment to explain a variable, the name isn't good enough.

## Functions Should Do One Thing

The single responsibility principle applies at every level of abstraction, from functions to modules to services. A function should do one thing, do it well, and do it only.

```typescript
// Bad: This function does too many things
function processUser(user: User): void {
  // Validates user data
  if (!user.email || !user.name) throw new Error('Invalid user');
  // Normalizes the email
  user.email = user.email.toLowerCase().trim();
  // Saves to database
  db.users.insert(user);
  // Sends welcome email
  emailService.sendWelcome(user.email);
  // Logs the event
  analytics.track('user_created', { userId: user.id });
}

// Good: Each function has a single responsibility
function validateUser(user: User): void {
  if (!user.email || !user.name) {
    throw new InvalidUserError(user);
  }
}

function normalizeEmail(email: string): string {
  return email.toLowerCase().trim();
}

function createUser(user: User): User {
  validateUser(user);
  user.email = normalizeEmail(user.email);
  return db.users.insert(user);
}
```

## The Boy Scout Rule

> "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it."

Every time you touch a file, leave it a little better than you found it. Rename a confusing variable. Extract a duplicated block. Add a missing type annotation. Small improvements compound over time.

## When Clean Code Goes Too Far

There's a counterpoint worth acknowledging. Over-abstraction, premature generalization, and excessive patterns can make code *harder* to understand, not easier. A three-line duplicated block is often clearer than a complex abstraction. The goal is clarity, not cleverness.

The pragmatic approach: write code for the current requirements. Refactor when patterns emerge naturally. Don't build frameworks for problems you don't have yet.

## The Real Measure

Clean code isn't measured by adherence to a style guide or the number of design patterns used. It's measured by how quickly a new team member can understand and confidently modify the codebase. If they're afraid to touch the code, something has gone wrong — no matter how "clean" it looks on paper.

Code is read far more often than it is written. Invest in readability, and your future self will thank you.
