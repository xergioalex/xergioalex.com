This is a **draft post** demo. In a real scenario, this article would still be a work in progress — incomplete sections, rough ideas, notes to self.

## Why This Post is a Draft

Draft posts have `draft: true` in their frontmatter. They are:

- **Hidden** from production builds entirely
- **Visible** in dev mode with the `?preview=all` query parameter
- Marked with an **amber "Draft" badge** in the blog listing and detail view

## Placeholder Section

This section would eventually contain the actual content about building CLI tools with Rust. For now, it demonstrates how a draft post looks in the blog UI.

> Draft posts are perfect for work-in-progress content that you want to preview locally before publishing.

## Notes to Self

- [ ] Add code examples for argument parsing
- [ ] Include benchmarks vs Node.js equivalent
- [ ] Screenshot of the final CLI in action
