For years, my personal website was a single page. A profile photo, my name, "Full Stack Developer," and a row of social media icons. That was it. It pointed people to my GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. It worked — in the same way a sticky note on a door "works" as a welcome sign.

But things changed over time. I started building [DailyBot](https://www.dailybot.com), giving talks about [Astro](/blog/astro-in-action/), [serverless architectures](/blog/introduction-to-serverless-iot/) and [AI](/blog/rebirth-of-artificial-intelligence/), contributing to communities like [Pereira Tech Talks](https://www.pereiratechtalks.com/), writing, experimenting with trading and hardware. And that page with a photo and five links no longer represented any of that.

So I decided to build a real one.

## The Old Site

This is what I had for a long time:

![My old personal website — a simple landing page with profile photo, name, and social links](/images/blog/posts/xergioalex-website/old-site.png)

Super simple. Just a photo and links to my networks. It did the job, but it didn't reflect what I'd actually been working on — DailyBot, Pereira Tech Talks, open source projects, dozens of tech talks, blog posts, trading experiments, hardware projects. I wanted a place that could hold all of that and still feel fast, clean, and easy to maintain.

I didn't want a template. I wanted something built from scratch — something that represented both my technical approach and my personal brand.

---

## The Brand Meets the Code

Before building the site, I'd already invested in something important: [my personal brand](/blog/personal-branding-xergioalex/). Working with designer **Koru** (Daniel Vasquez Correa), I developed the **Ninja Coder** identity — a brand with a complete visual system, from the ninja character with `<>` on its forehead to the shuriken X's in the logotype, plus a carefully defined color palette.

That brand was sitting in a repo, waiting for a real home. Building this website was the opportunity to bring it to life. The deep ninja blue became the foundation of the dark theme. The bold red became the accent color you see on buttons, links, and interactive details. The ninja face became the favicon. The horizontal logo became what you see up in the header.

Basically, the entire visual identity of the site was born from that brand. It wasn't "inspired by" — it was built directly on top of it. The colors, the typography, the overall tone, even the dark and light mode variants. It all comes from there.

---

## Why Astro

I evaluated several frameworks before landing on [Astro](https://astro.build). Next.js, Gatsby, Hugo, Eleventy — they're all capable. But Astro won because its philosophy aligned perfectly with what I needed: a content-heavy personal site that should be mostly static, insanely fast, and easy to extend.

### Zero JavaScript by Default

This is Astro's killer feature. Unlike React-based frameworks that ship a full runtime to the browser, Astro generates **pure static HTML** at build time. No JavaScript is sent to the client unless you explicitly ask for it. For a personal site and blog, most pages are just content — they don't need a JavaScript runtime. The result: pages that load in milliseconds, not seconds.

### Islands Architecture

When you *do* need interactivity — a search bar, a navigation menu, a theme toggle — Astro uses an **islands architecture**. Each interactive component is a self-contained island that hydrates independently. The rest of the page stays as static HTML. You control exactly when and how each island loads:

- `client:load` — Hydrate immediately (for critical UI like navigation)
- `client:visible` — Hydrate only when the component scrolls into view
- `client:idle` — Hydrate when the browser is idle

This means I can have a page with 95% static content and one interactive search component, and only that search component ships JavaScript. Everything else is zero-cost HTML.

### Content Collections

Astro has a first-class system for managing structured content. Blog posts are defined with **Zod schemas** that validate frontmatter at build time — title, description, publication date, hero image, layout variant, tags. If a post is missing a required field or has the wrong type, the build fails immediately. No runtime surprises.

```typescript
const blog = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.coerce.date(),
    heroImage: z.string().optional(),
    heroLayout: z.enum(['banner', 'side-by-side', 'minimal', 'none']).default('banner'),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  }),
});
```

This gives me type safety across the entire content pipeline — from Markdown files to component props to rendered pages.

### Built-In Everything

Routing, layouts, MDX support, image optimization, sitemap generation, RSS feeds — Astro handles all of this out of the box or through official integrations. I didn't need to wire together a dozen independent packages. One framework, one configuration, one build command.

---

## Why Svelte (and Why It's a Perfect Match for Astro)

Astro is **UI-agnostic** — you can use React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, or plain HTML for your interactive components. I chose [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and it turned out to be a perfect complement.

### Compiled, Not Runtime

Svelte's core philosophy mirrors Astro's: **do the work at build time, not at runtime**. While React ships a virtual DOM diffing engine to every user's browser, Svelte compiles your components into minimal, surgical DOM operations during the build. The output is vanilla JavaScript — no framework overhead, no virtual DOM, no runtime library.

For an Astro site that already ships zero JavaScript by default, this matters enormously. When I *do* need an interactive island, Svelte ensures that island is as small as possible. The blog search component, the navigation header, the image lightbox — they all compile down to tiny bundles.

### Truly Reactive with Less Code

Svelte 5 (which this site uses at version `5.50`) introduced **runes** — a compiler-driven reactivity system that's both more powerful and more intuitive than previous versions. State management is straightforward:

```svelte
<script>
  let searchQuery = $state('');
  let results = $derived(posts.filter(p => p.title.includes(searchQuery)));
</script>
```

No `useState`, no `useEffect`, no dependency arrays. The compiler figures out what depends on what and generates the minimal update code. For interactive components in a content site, this simplicity is a genuine advantage — less code means fewer bugs and easier maintenance.

### Small Bundle, Big Impact

Svelte components compile to an average of **30-40% less JavaScript** than equivalent React components. On a site where every kilobyte of JavaScript is intentional (thanks to Astro's zero-JS default), this difference is significant. The entire interactive layer of XergioAleX.com — 15 Svelte components covering search, navigation, lightbox, timelines, and more — compiles down to a fraction of what a single React runtime would weigh.

### What Svelte Powers on This Site

Here's exactly where Svelte brings interactivity to an otherwise static site:

- **`Header.svelte`** — Sticky navigation with dropdown menus, language switcher, and responsive behavior. Uses the disclosure pattern for accessibility (not `role="menu"`).
- **`MobileMenu.svelte`** — Animated mobile navigation drawer with smooth open/close transitions.
- **`StaticBlogSearch.svelte`** — The blog listing orchestrator. Lazy-loads a Fuse.js search index via `requestIdleCallback`, implements debounced search with result caching, and manages pagination in both browse and search modes.
- **`BlogCard.svelte`** — Post cards with WebP source switching, search highlight rendering, and lazy image loading.
- **`BlogImageLightbox.svelte`** — Full-featured image viewer using the native `<dialog>` element for accessibility (focus trapping, Escape key), prev/next navigation, and touch swipe support. Hydrated with `client:idle` so it costs nothing on initial load.
- **`PortfolioTimeline.svelte`**, **`TechTalksTimeline.svelte`**, **`TradingTimeline.svelte`**, **`DailyBotTimeline.svelte`** — Interactive timelines for different portfolio sections.

Every one of these uses the lightest hydration directive that works. The lightbox uses `client:idle`. The header uses `client:load` because navigation needs to be interactive immediately. This granular control is what makes the Astro + Svelte combination so powerful.

## The Full Feature Set

What started as "I need a better landing page" evolved into a full personal platform. Here's what XergioAleX.com does today:

### Bilingual (English & Spanish)

Every page exists in both languages with full route parity. English lives at `/` and Spanish at `/es/`. The i18n system is architected for scalability — adding a third language requires zero changes to existing components:

1. Add the language code to a TypeScript union type
2. Create a translation file (~950 lines of UI strings)
3. Create thin page wrappers (3-line files that pass `lang="pt"`)
4. Create a blog content directory

The translation system covers **everything** — navigation, footer, all 12 specialized pages, blog UI (search, pagination, reading time, tags), error pages. Even dynamic strings like "3 results found" and "Page 2 of 5" are translated via functions that take parameters.

### Dark Mode

System-aware theme detection with manual toggle and localStorage persistence. The implementation prevents the dreaded "flash of wrong theme" on page load by inlining the theme script in the HTML `<head>`. Both the light and dark themes are designed around the Ninja Coder brand palette.

### Blog System

The blog is the heart of the site, built on Astro's Content Collections with Markdown and MDX:

- **36+ posts** in each language, spanning a decade of technical writing (2016-2026)
- **Four hero layouts** — `banner` (full-width), `side-by-side` (image + title columns), `minimal` (thumbnail), `none` (text-only) — chosen based on image aspect ratio
- **Tag-based filtering** with dedicated tag pages
- **Client-side search** powered by Fuse.js with fuzzy matching, debounced input, result caching (up to 50 entries), and search highlight rendering
- **Pagination** at 30 posts per page, working in both browse and search modes
- **Related posts** scored by shared tag count with fallback to latest posts
- **Reading time estimation** that strips code blocks and markdown syntax before counting words (200 words/minute)
- **RSS feeds** in both languages, automatically excluding demo posts
- **Image lightbox** for inline post images with keyboard navigation and touch swipe

### Specialized Portfolio Sections

Beyond the blog, the site has dedicated sections with interactive timelines:

- **DailyBot** — The story of building an AI-powered async collaboration platform
- **Tech Talks** — History of presentations and community events
- **Portfolio** — Projects and technical work
- **Trading** — Trading journal and experiments
- **Entrepreneur**, **Maker**, **Hobbies**, **Foodie** — Other facets of life

Each section uses a shared timeline component pattern in Svelte, keeping the codebase DRY while allowing per-section customization.

### SEO & Structured Data

Every page includes:

- Canonical URLs with `hreflang` tags for all language variants (plus `x-default`)
- Open Graph meta tags with 1200x630 images
- Twitter Card markup (`summary_large_image`)
- **Three JSON-LD schemas per page**: `WebSite`, `Person` (with `sameAs` links to GitHub, LinkedIn, X, Instagram), and `Organization` (DailyBot)
- XML sitemap (auto-generated, filtered to exclude internal pages)
- Pagination SEO (`rel="prev"` / `rel="next"`)
- `robots.txt` and `llms.txt` for machine discovery

### Accessibility

The site targets **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** and a **Lighthouse Accessibility score of 100**:

- All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio (approved color pairings documented)
- Every image has explicit `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shifts
- Semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Keyboard-navigable interactive elements
- ARIA patterns: disclosure for dropdowns, `role="progressbar"` for skill bars
- `font-display: swap` for custom fonts (Atkinson Hyperlegible)

## Architecture Deep Dive

### The Page Wrapper Pattern

One of the key architectural decisions: **every page is a thin 3-line wrapper**. The actual page logic, layout, SEO metadata, and content live inside shared `*Page.astro` components in `src/components/pages/`. The wrappers in `src/pages/` only handle routing and pass a `lang` string literal:

```astro
---
// src/pages/about.astro (English)
import AboutPage from '@/components/pages/AboutPage.astro';
---
<AboutPage lang="en" />
```

```astro
---
// src/pages/es/about.astro (Spanish)
import AboutPage from '@/components/pages/AboutPage.astro';
---
<AboutPage lang="es" />
```

This means every page's content, translations, and layout exist in **one place**. Adding a new language means adding a new 3-line wrapper — no component changes, no logic duplication. The site currently has 52 page files but only 13 distinct page components.

### Performance Architecture

Performance isn't a feature — it's a core architectural value:

- **`build.inlineStylesheets: 'always'`** — All CSS is inlined directly into HTML, eliminating render-blocking stylesheet requests entirely
- **Aggressive caching via Cloudflare** — Hashed assets get 1-year immutable cache, fonts get 1-year, images get 30 days, HTML always revalidates
- **WebP generation pipeline** — A prebuild step automatically generates WebP variants for all images (homepage, blog shared, and per-post) using Sharp
- **Font preloading** — Atkinson Hyperlegible woff files are preloaded in `<head>` with `font-display: swap`
- **Lazy loading everywhere** — Below-fold images use `loading="lazy"`, Svelte islands use `client:visible` or `client:idle`
- **Zero render-blocking JS** — Theme detection is the only inlined script, and it's tiny

### Image Optimization Pipeline

Images go through a dedicated staging workflow built on **Sharp**:

1. Drop raw images in `public/images/blog/_staging/` with naming convention `{slug}--{name}.{ext}`
2. Run `npm run images:optimize`
3. The script auto-detects presets by aspect ratio: heroes resize to 1400x700, square images to 800x800, inline images to 1200px wide
4. JPEG quality 80, PNG-to-JPEG conversion at quality 85, optional WebP at quality 80
5. Outputs move to `public/images/blog/posts/{slug}/`

The prebuild step (`npm run prebuild`) then generates WebP variants for all blog images automatically before every production build.

### Testing

The project uses **Vitest** with **@testing-library/svelte** for testing:

- Unit tests for blog utilities (post slugs, pagination, filtering, reading time)
- Unit tests for the i18n system (language detection, URL generation, locale handling)
- Unit tests for the translation system (completeness, key parity across languages)
- Unit tests for the search API (post serialization, demo filtering)
- Component tests for Svelte components (BlogCard rendering, BlogPagination behavior)
- Coverage target: 80%+ on `src/lib/`

## A Generative Web: Built for Humans and AI

One of the design goals that makes this project a bit different: the site is **generative** — structured to be discoverable, readable, and extensible by both humans and AI systems.

### Machine-Readable Discovery

- **`llms.txt`** — A machine-readable summary of the site at the root, following the emerging standard for LLM-friendly websites. Includes site structure, author info, and a link to `llms-full.txt` for the comprehensive version.
- **JSON-LD on every page** — Three structured data schemas (Person, WebSite, Organization) so search engines and AI systems can extract structured information.
- **Semantic HTML throughout** — Proper heading hierarchy, landmark elements, and semantic tags that make content parseable.

### The AGENTS.md System

The entire repository is documented through **`AGENTS.md`** — a single source of truth for all AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Gemini). It contains:

- Architecture patterns with code examples
- Mandatory coding standards and import conventions
- Multilingual synchronization rules
- Performance and accessibility requirements
- Common mistakes to avoid (28 don'ts, 28 dos)
- A pre-commit checklist

This means any AI agent can pick up the project and contribute following the same standards. The documentation is designed to scale with the project.

### Skills & Agents System

Beyond documentation, the repository includes a complete **Skills & Agents system** — reusable procedures and specialized personas that AI assistants can invoke:

**14 Skills** (slash commands): `quick-fix`, `add-blog-post`, `translate-sync`, `write-tests`, `fix-lint`, `type-fix`, `refactor-safe`, `security-check`, `add-page`, `add-component`, `update-styles`, `doc-edit`, `git-commit-push`, `pr-review-lite`

**6 Agents** (specialized workers): `architect` (system design), `content-writer` (blog posts), `executor` (task implementation), `reviewer` (code review), `i18n-guardian` (translation quality), `security-auditor` (security review)

Each skill and agent has a defined model tier (cheap/standard/frontier) to optimize for cost and latency. The result: AI assistants can create blog posts, synchronize translations, run security audits, and review code — all following the project's standards automatically.

### Internal Development Hub

The site includes a **dev-only Internal Hub** at `/internal/` with 17 pages across three pillars:

- **UI Design System** (11 pages) — Visual reference for colors, typography, spacing, radius, buttons, badges, cards, forms, layouts, and brand tokens
- **Staff Guide** (4 pages) — Tech stack documentation, file structure, naming conventions, and performance guidelines
- **Auto-Generated Sitemap** — Build-time discovery of all site pages

The hub is automatically excluded from production builds through a three-layer system: a post-build deletion hook, sitemap XML filtering, and `noindex` meta tags. It exists purely as a reference for developers and AI agents working on the project.

## From One Page to a Platform

Going from a single landing page with a photo and five social links to a full personal platform was a deliberate choice. I wanted a place that could grow with my work — more projects, more posts, more languages, more ideas — without becoming a maintenance burden.

Astro made the foundation possible: static, fast, content-first. Svelte made the interactive parts feel native and lightweight. Together they form a combination that's hard to beat for content-driven sites — you get the performance of static HTML with the richness of a modern component framework, and you only pay for interactivity where you actually need it.

The brand gave it a soul. The AI-ready architecture gave it a future.

If you're thinking about building your personal site, I'd recommend giving this stack a try. And if you're curious about the implementation, the whole thing is open source.

**Repository:** [xergioalex/xergioalex.com](https://github.com/xergioalex/xergioalex.com)
**Live site:** [xergioalex.com](https://xergioalex.com)
**Brand assets:** [xergioalex/personal-branding](https://github.com/xergioalex/personal-branding)

Let's keep building.
