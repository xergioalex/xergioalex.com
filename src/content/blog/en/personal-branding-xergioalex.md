I spent years building products, writing code, and shipping features — but I never really thought about how I presented myself visually. My GitHub profile, my talks, my social media... everything felt disconnected. At some point I realized I wanted something that tied it all together. Something that felt like *me*.

This is how the XergioAleX brand came to be.

## Why I Decided to Build a Personal Brand

For most of my career, I let the work speak for itself. Repositories, deployments, products — that was my identity. And honestly, for a long time that was enough.

But as I got more involved in giving talks, writing, sharing open source projects, and building [DailyBot](https://www.dailybot.com) as CTO and Co-founder, I started noticing that having a recognizable visual identity actually matters. Not in a superficial way — it's just that when people see your content across different platforms, a consistent look helps them connect the dots. It builds familiarity.

So I decided to invest in it.

## Why a Ninja?

The idea came pretty naturally. I've always liked the analogy of a ninja when thinking about how good engineers work:

- **You move in silence** — The best infrastructure is the kind nobody notices. The best code "just works." You deploy, things scale, bugs get fixed... and ideally nobody had to panic about it.

- **You never stop training** — Staying relevant across AI, DevOps, full-stack, open source, and product development means you're always learning. There's no finish line.

- **You're ready for anything** — My path has gone through robotics, distributed systems, trading algorithms, cloud infrastructure, developer tools, AI platforms... The ninja idea captured that range well.

- **Code is your tool** — Languages, frameworks, architectures — you pick the right one for the job and execute with precision.

It wasn't just a "cool" concept. It genuinely resonated with how I see my work.

## Working with Koru

I worked with **Daniel Vasquez Correa** (known as **Koru**), a graphic designer and illustrator based in Colombia. His style was a perfect fit — bold, modern, with great character work. Exactly what this concept needed.

I'm really happy with how it turned out.

## Breaking Down the Logo

Let me walk you through the different elements, because there's a lot of thought packed into this design.

### The Ninja Character

The central figure is a stylized ninja — hooded, sharp angles, leaning forward. It has that esports/gaming mascot vibe which I really like. The face is mostly hidden by the hood, with only the eyes visible. I like the idea that the work speaks louder than the person.

### The `<>` on the Forehead

This is one of my favorite details. The angle brackets `<>` sit right on the ninja's forehead — the universal symbol for code. It's what turns this from just a ninja into a **coder**. Code is how I think, how I solve problems, how I build things. Having it literally on the forehead felt right.

### The Shuriken X's ✦

This one is pretty clever: the letter **X** in "**X**ERGIO ALE**X**" is designed as a **shuriken** — a ninja throwing star. So the typography itself carries the brand concept. Every time you read the name, the ninja theme is right there in the letters.

### The Banner

The name sits on a bold ribbon/banner below the character, giving the whole thing a badge-like feel. It's inspired by esports team logos — dynamic, angular, and it looks good at pretty much any size.

## Color Palette

Here are the colors that make up the brand. I gave them names because... why not.

### Primary Colors

| Color | Name | Hex | RGB | What it's for |
|:-----:|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| <span style="display:inline-block;width:20px;height:20px;background:#152E45;border-radius:4px;border:1px solid #fff3"></span> | **Ninja Navy** | `#152E45` | `21, 46, 69` | The main color — ninja body, backgrounds, base surfaces |
| <span style="display:inline-block;width:20px;height:20px;background:#E51641;border-radius:4px;border:1px solid #fff3"></span> | **Crimson Strike** | `#E51641` | `229, 22, 65` | The accent — highlights, energy, the things you want people to notice |

**Ninja Navy** is a deep dark blue. Think terminal at midnight. It carries most of the visual weight.

**Crimson Strike** is the pop of energy. It shows up on the ninja's right side, the banner edges, and interactive elements on the site. A little goes a long way.

### Secondary Colors

| Color | Name | Hex | RGB | What it's for |
|:-----:|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| <span style="display:inline-block;width:20px;height:20px;background:#637996;border-radius:4px;border:1px solid #fff3"></span> | **Shadow Steel** | `#637996` | `99, 121, 150` | Depth and detail — the subtler stuff |
| <span style="display:inline-block;width:20px;height:20px;background:#0F1124;border-radius:4px;border:1px solid #fff3"></span> | **Void Black** | `#0F1124` | `15, 17, 36` | Deep shadows and dark backgrounds |
| <span style="display:inline-block;width:20px;height:20px;background:#FFFFFF;border-radius:4px;border:1px solid #9993"></span> | **Pure White** | `#FFFFFF` | `255, 255, 255` | The `<>` symbol, eyes, highlights |

**Shadow Steel** adds depth to the ninja character — it models the left side while Crimson Strike hits the right, creating that sense of dimension.

**Void Black** is for the darkest areas. It's what I use as the dark mode base.

**Pure White** is reserved for the key focal points: the code symbol on the forehead, the eyes, and major highlights. These are the elements your eye goes to first.

### How to Combine Them

- **Main pairing:** Ninja Navy + Crimson Strike — this is the signature look
- **Dark mode:** Void Black background, Crimson Strike accents, white text
- **Light mode:** White background, Ninja Navy text, Crimson Strike accents
- **One rule:** Don't use Crimson Strike as a background for text — it's an accent, not a surface

## Logo Variants

The brand has a few different configurations depending on the context:

### Full Logo (Lockup)

The complete thing: ninja character + name banner. This is what you use when you have space — headers, hero sections, presentations.

<div style="background:#0F1124;border-radius:12px;padding:2rem;text-align:center">

![Full Logo](/images/blog/branding/full_logo_white.png)

</div>

### Isologo (Icon)

Just the ninja, no text. Good for favicons, app icons, social media avatars, and anywhere the full logo would be too small to read.

![Isologo](/images/blog/branding/isologo_white.png)

### Ninja Face (Compact Icon)

A close-up of just the ninja's face — even more minimal than the isologo. This is the version used in the site favicon and very small contexts where you only need the essence of the character.

<div style="background:#0F1124;border-radius:12px;padding:2rem;display:flex;justify-content:center">
  <img src="/images/isologo.svg" alt="Ninja Face" style="max-height:160px" />
</div>

### Logotype (Wordmark)

Just the "XERGIO ALEX" text with the shuriken X's. Works well for horizontal layouts, email signatures, or when you want something more subtle.

<div style="background:#0F1124;border-radius:12px;padding:2rem;text-align:center">

![Logotype](/images/blog/branding/logo_text_white.png)

</div>

### Small Version (Horizontal)

The ninja face paired with the text in a compact horizontal layout. This is the version you see in the site header — it works great for navigation bars and tight horizontal spaces.

<div style="background:#0F1124;border-radius:12px;padding:2rem;text-align:center">

![Small Version](/images/logo_small_version_white.svg)

</div>

### Color Modes

Each variant comes in white (for dark backgrounds) and black (for light backgrounds).

## Quick Style Guide

Some basic guidelines for using the brand consistently:

**Do:**
- Use the full logo on dark backgrounds
- Keep clear space around the logo
- Use Crimson Strike for interactive elements
- Pair Ninja Navy with white text

**Don't:**
- Stretch or distort the logo
- Use Crimson Strike as a text background
- Pull individual elements out of the logo
- Add effects like drop shadows or gradients

The logo text uses a custom typeface made for this brand. For everything else, clean sans-serif fonts work best alongside it.

## What's Next

For a while, this brand lived as a bunch of files in a repo and not much else. Now I'm actively using it everywhere — this website, my social profiles, my talks, everything.

It's more than a logo to me. It represents how I approach my work: stay sharp, keep learning, execute with care. The ninja coder thing started as a fun idea but it's become a real part of how I present myself to the world.

Let's keep building.
