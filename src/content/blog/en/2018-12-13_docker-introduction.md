Docker with a focus on **microservice-oriented architectures**. The goal: connect both worlds — on one side, what defines a microservice and why it matters; on the other, how Docker and containers fit into that picture for building autonomous, isolated, and scalable systems.

## What is a Microservice?

A microservice does **one thing and does it very well**. It's a self-contained unit of functionality. In the talk I broke down the characteristics that typically define this architectural style:

- **Autonomous** — Identified by a unique location (URL). It's a self-contained unit.
- **Isolated** — You can modify, test, and deploy it without impacting other areas of the system.
- **Elastic** — Scales independently: vertically (more resources) or horizontally (more instances).
- **Resilient** — Fault tolerant and highly available.
- **Responsive** — Responds in a reasonable amount of time.
- **Message-oriented** — Relies on asynchronous message-passing to establish boundaries between components.
- **Programmable** — Exposes APIs for developers, administrators, and applications composed from multiple services.
- **Automated** — Its lifecycle is managed through automation: dev, build, test, staging, production, and distribution.

## Are Microservices the Silver Bullet?

**No.** They're a tool, not a religion. The talk covered when they help and when they add complexity. The key is understanding the trade-offs: more services mean more network latency, more operational complexity, and challenges with distributed transactions. Not every project needs microservices from day one.

## Docker Concepts

I moved on to Docker basics: **containers**, **images**, **Docker Compose** for orchestrating multiple services, and how they fit into a development and deployment flow. I also mentioned **Docker Machine** and **Docker Swarm** for more advanced setups.

## Demos

I showed live demos during the talk, including a load balancer with Docker. The code is available in the repos I shared.
