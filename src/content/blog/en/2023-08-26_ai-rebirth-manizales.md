**AI Rebirth** is about the awakening of artificial intelligence — and why we're at the start of something real. I didn't want to give a generic overview. I wanted to share what I was actually seeing: a revolution that had just woken up. Something I was living every day at DailyBot.

## Why I Chose This Topic

I had three goals in mind: understand the **state of the art** of AI, explore its **possibilities**, and answer a question that kept coming up — *why should we be learning AI right now?* At DailyBot we were already building with these tools. I could feel the shift. I wanted the audience to see what I saw: we're not in a hype bubble. We're at the start of something real, and I wanted them to feel that too.

## From AI Winter to the Generative Boom

I walked them through the history. **Deep learning**, ImageNet, computer vision, style transfer. The **AI winter** — that long stretch where progress felt slow. Then **2022**, and everything changed. **Generative AI** exploded.

GPT-2, GPT-3, DALL·E, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion, BLOOM, Whisper. Each release felt like a step up. **ChatGPT** in November 2022 — 100 million users in months. It could write code, answer questions, generate SQL from natural language. Startups built on top of it overnight. I was watching it happen from the inside.

## GPT-4 and the Multimodal Shift

**GPT-4** had been out for a few months. Multimodal, cheaper, 32K tokens. Microsoft was integrating Copilot everywhere. Google had announced PaLM 2, Bard, Duet AI. The future of work was being rewritten in real time.

I showed what was coming: **synthetic audio** — including the demo with my own cloned voice — **text-to-video** tools, **AutoGPT**. The message I wanted to leave: this is not the end. It's the beginning. And we get to decide how we show up.

---

## What This Means for Us

I ended with two words: **transformation** and **opportunity**. The tools are here. The APIs are open. The question isn't whether AI will change how we build — it already is. The question is whether we'll be part of it. I hope some of them felt the same thing I did.
