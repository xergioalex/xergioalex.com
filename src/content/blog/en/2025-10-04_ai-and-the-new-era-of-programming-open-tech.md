You're at a hackathon. You have a weekend — maybe less — to turn an idea into something that works. I gave this workshop at [Open Tech Hackathon](https://opentechhackathon.com/) because I wanted to give participants something they could use *that same day*: a map of the AI tools that actually help you ship, and a mental model for how to use them without getting lost in the hype.

The **Vibe Coding e IA** session on October 4 was aimed at one thing: inspire and guide. Not theory. Not "the future of work." Concrete tools and a way of thinking that would help them build their initiatives faster.

## What I Wanted to Leave Them With

Three things. First: **which tools to try** — Cursor, Codex, Claude Code. Second: **how to think about them** — you're not replacing yourself, you're multiplying. Third: **a mindset** — describe what you want, let the agent iterate, you steer. That's vibe coding. That's what I wanted them to take into their projects.

## The Tools: Cursor, Codex, Claude Code

I walked through the three code agents that matter most right now. **Cursor** — AI-first IDE, great for rapid prototyping. You describe a feature, it suggests code, you refine. Perfect for hackathon speed. **Codex** (powering GitHub Copilot) — inline suggestions, autocomplete on steroids. You stay in flow, it fills in the boilerplate. **Claude Code** — strong at reasoning and long context. Good for architecture decisions, refactoring, debugging. Each has a sweet spot. I wanted them to know: pick one, learn its shortcuts, and use it from day one of the hackathon.

## The Mental Model: Conductor, Not Coder

The slide that stuck: **"New role of developers: orchestrators and supervisors."** I didn't want to scare them. I wanted to reframe. You're not typing less — you're deciding more. You set the direction. You define the problem. The agent writes the first draft, runs the tests, suggests fixes. You review, correct, and move on. In a hackathon, that means more iterations in less time. More ideas tested. More prototypes that actually run.

## Resources for Hackathon Participants

I ended with a few pointers so they could start right away:

- **Cursor** — [cursor.com](https://cursor.com) — Try the Composer for multi-file edits. Describe a feature in plain English, get code.
- **GitHub Copilot** — [github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) — If you're in VS Code or JetBrains, turn it on. It pays off in the first hour.
- **Claude** — [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) — Use it for architecture, API design, or debugging. Paste your error, ask for a fix.
- **Slides** — [View the full deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cWPCrsKVjDlc3dquELywXl5QvM1lLdXJLi4ZGbiTp4w/edit) — All the concepts and examples from the workshop.
