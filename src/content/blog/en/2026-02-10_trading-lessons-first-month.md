One month in. It feels like both an eternity and a blink. The markets have a way of compressing and stretching time depending on whether you're in a trade or watching from the sidelines. Here's what I've learned so far — the things that worked, the mistakes I made, and the patterns I discovered by journaling every session.

---

## What Worked

**Having a trading plan.** Before I started, I wrote down my rules: which pairs to trade (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY), what timeframes to use (daily and 4-hour), what setups to look for (liquidity grabs, order block retests, fair value gaps), and how much to risk per trade (1% of account balance). Having this document to reference kept me grounded when emotions wanted to take over.

The first time I felt the urge to break my rules — to take a trade on a 15-minute chart because it "looked good" — I opened my plan and re-read it. That friction was enough to stop me. The plan acts like a circuit breaker for impulsive decisions.

**Journaling everything.** Every trade, every observation, every mistake — all documented in Notion. Looking back at my journal entries, I can already see patterns in my behavior. I tend to overtrade on Mondays (probably excitement from the weekend, eager to jump back in). My best decisions come mid-week when I'm calmer and more patient. Fridays are hit or miss — sometimes disciplined, sometimes sloppy.

**Starting small.** I began with minimal position sizes — micro lots, risking only 0.5% per trade instead of the planned 1%. The goal wasn't to make money — it was to learn the mechanics and build habits. This took a lot of pressure off and allowed me to focus on process over outcomes. I treated it like a public beta: test the system before scaling it.

**Using alerts instead of watching charts.** I set price alerts on TradingView for key levels. This freed me from staring at charts all day. When price approaches a zone I'm watching, I get a notification, review the setup, and decide. This removed a lot of emotional noise and helped me avoid overtrading.

## What Didn't Work

**Overanalyzing.** I spent too many hours staring at charts, looking for the "perfect" entry. Analysis paralysis is real. I'd mark levels, draw trendlines, check multiple timeframes, watch for confirmation — and by the time I decided to act, the move was halfway done or the setup was invalidated. Sometimes good enough is good enough. Waiting for perfection means missing valid opportunities.

**Trading during news events.** Twice I got caught in volatile moves around economic data releases (NFP and CPI). The spreads widened, the price spiked in both directions, and my stop losses got hit in ways I didn't expect. My 20-pip stop turned into a 35-pip loss because of slippage. Lesson learned: respect the economic calendar. If a major release is coming, stay out or close positions before it hits.

**Ignoring my own rules.** There were a couple of trades where I moved my stop loss further away because I "felt" the market would come back in my favor. It didn't. Both times, price hit my original stop level, kept going, and eventually hit my widened stop for a bigger loss. This was my most expensive lesson — your plan exists for a reason. If you're moving your stop to avoid a loss, you're lying to yourself about the trade quality.

**The Monday overtrading pattern.** I discovered this by journaling: on Mondays, I took more trades than any other day, and my win rate was lower. I was forcing action. The market doesn't care that I'm excited to start the week. Now I have a rule: no trades on Monday unless the setup is textbook perfect. Observation only.

## A Specific Trade That Taught Me Something

**The GBP/USD news whipsaw (February 5).** UK inflation data was scheduled for 7:00 AM. I knew this. My plan said "no trading 30 minutes before and after major news." But I saw what looked like a clean liquidity grab on the 4-hour chart, price sitting at an order block, and I convinced myself the setup was strong enough to hold through the news.

Price spiked 80 pips down in 2 minutes, hit my stop, then reversed 120 pips up — exactly where I thought it would go. I was right about the direction. Wrong about the timing. The lesson: being right doesn't matter if you can't survive the volatility. The setup was valid, but the execution was reckless. I broke my rule, paid for it, and watched the trade play out without me.

That one hurt. But it's burned into my memory now. I won't make that mistake again.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Risk management is everything.** It's not glamorous, but protecting your capital is the foundation of longevity in trading. Every trade should answer: "How much am I willing to lose?" before you think about how much you could win.

2. **Consistency beats intensity.** Small, disciplined actions every day compound over time. Big, emotional swings destroy accounts. It's the same principle as compound interest or code quality — small improvements stack up.

3. **The market doesn't care about your opinion.** Being right isn't the goal — managing risk is. You can have a 60% win rate and still lose money if your risk-reward is poor. You can have a 40% win rate and make money if your winners are bigger than your losers.

4. **Psychology is 80% of the game.** Technical analysis is the easy part. You can learn order blocks, liquidity concepts, and market structure in a few weeks. Controlling your emotions, staying patient, and following your rules under pressure — that's where the real challenge is. And that's what separates traders who survive from those who blow up.

5. **Journaling reveals blind spots.** Without my journal, I wouldn't have noticed the Monday pattern. I wouldn't have seen that my best trades came after waiting 24+ hours to confirm a level. The data doesn't lie. Writing it down makes it visible.

## The Numbers (Because Accountability Matters)

- **Total trades:** 12
- **Win rate:** 58% (7 wins, 5 losses)
- **Average risk per trade:** 0.5% of account
- **Largest win:** +2.1%
- **Largest loss:** -1.4% (the GBP/USD news trade)
- **Net result:** +1.8% (account up slightly, but that's not the point yet)

The goal this month wasn't profit — it was learning. The fact that I didn't lose money is a bonus. What matters more: I followed my plan 10 out of 12 times. The two times I didn't, I paid for it.

## Looking Ahead

Month two is about refinement. I want to narrow my focus to fewer setups (liquidity grabs and order block retests only — no fair value gaps until I master these). I want to improve my entry timing by waiting for confirmation instead of jumping in early. And I want to keep building the journaling habit — it's already the most valuable tool I have.

The foundation is laid. Now it's time to build on it.

Let's keep learning.
