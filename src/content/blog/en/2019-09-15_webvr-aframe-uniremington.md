Virtual reality felt like a luxury when I started exploring it. High-end headsets like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift cost hundreds of dollars. The barrier to entry was high — expensive hardware, platform-specific development, complex 3D engines. Then I discovered **WebVR** and **A-Frame**, and everything changed.

This talk at Universidad Remington was about bringing VR to a university audience — students, developers, and curious minds who might not have a gaming PC or a $500 headset. The web is the most accessible distribution platform we have. If you can make VR work in a browser, you can reach anyone with a smartphone and a $15 Cardboard viewer.

Before diving into the tech, I started by inviting the audience to join the local tech communities in Pereira: [Sirius](https://sirius.utp.edu.co/jointdeveloper/), [PyPereira](https://pypereira.co/), [Pereira Tech Talks](https://pereiratechtalks.com/), [PereiraJs](https://pereirajs.org/). These communities are where real learning happens — through meetups, workshops, and shared projects.

## VR, AR, and Mixed Reality

First, the definitions:

**Virtual Reality (VR)** — A fully immersive digital environment. You put on a headset and you're somewhere else. The real world disappears. Examples: exploring a virtual museum, walking through an architectural model, playing a game in a 3D world.

**Augmented Reality (AR)** — Digital elements overlaid on the real world. You see your surroundings, but with added information or objects. Examples: Pokémon GO, furniture preview apps, navigation overlays.

**Mixed Reality (MR)** — A blend of VR and AR where digital and physical objects interact. Digital objects can occlude real ones, and vice versa. Examples: Microsoft HoloLens experiences, advanced AR apps with spatial awareness.

The hardware landscape in 2019 ranged from expensive to accessible:

- **High-end:** HTC Vive (~$500+), Oculus Rift (~$400), Sony PlayStation VR (~$300)
- **Mid-range:** Oculus Go (~$200), Samsung Gear VR (~$130), Google Daydream (~$79)
- **Accessible:** Google Cardboard (~$7), generic VR Box viewers (~$15)

That price gap is huge. If VR development required a $500 headset, it would stay niche. But with Cardboard, anyone with a smartphone can try it. **Mass distribution changes the game.** That's where the web comes in.

## Why WebVR?

The web is the most important mass distribution platform. No app stores, no installation, no platform gatekeeping. Just a URL. If VR can run in a browser, it becomes accessible to billions of devices.

**WebVR** (now evolved into **WebXR**) is the W3C standard that defines the APIs a browser must expose to create VR experiences. It handles:

- Device detection (headsets, controllers)
- Pose tracking (head position, rotation)
- Stereoscopic rendering (left/right eye views)
- Input handling (gaze, controllers, voice)

Most WebVR experiences weigh **less than 2 MB**. Compare that to a native VR app, which can be hundreds of megabytes. You load a URL, and you're in VR. No download, no wait.

You don't need to learn new technologies. If you know **HTML** and **JavaScript**, you can build VR. **A-Frame** makes it even easier by letting you define 3D scenes with HTML-like syntax. Under the hood, A-Frame uses **Three.js**, a popular 3D library built on **WebGL**. If you already know Three.js or WebGL, adding WebVR support is just a bit of code. If you don't, A-Frame abstracts the complexity.

## A-Frame: Entity-Component System

[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) is a framework for building VR experiences with web technologies. It uses an **Entity-Component System (ECS)** architecture, borrowed from game engines:

**Entities** — Container objects that components attach to. Think of an entity as a "thing" in the scene: a box, a light, a camera, a sound. Entities define **what** exists.

**Components** — Reusable modules that provide appearance, behavior, or functionality. Components define **how** entities look and act. Examples: `geometry`, `material`, `position`, `rotation`, `light`, `sound`.

**Systems** — Global managers that handle logic for all instances of a component. Systems are less common in simple scenes but useful for optimization and shared state.

Here's a simple A-Frame scene:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <a-scene>
      <a-box position="-1 0.5 -3" rotation="0 45 0" color="#4CC3D9"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>
    </a-scene>
  </body>
</html>
```

That's it. Open it in a browser, and you're in a 3D scene. Click the VR button, and it switches to stereo mode for Cardboard or a headset. No build step, no complex setup.

A-Frame also has an **inspector** (press `Ctrl+Alt+I` while viewing a scene) that lets you inspect and tweak entities in real time. It's like browser DevTools for VR.

## Coordinate System

A-Frame uses a **right-handed coordinate system**:

- **X-axis:** Left (-) to right (+)
- **Y-axis:** Down (-) to up (+)
- **Z-axis:** Forward (-) to backward (+)

Position is in meters. `position="0 1.6 -2"` means: at origin horizontally, 1.6 meters up (roughly eye height), and 2 meters forward into the scene.

Understanding this matters for placing objects naturally and designing comfortable VR experiences.

## The Demos

## What Resonated with the Audience

The energy in the room shifted when people realized they didn't need expensive hardware to try VR. A few students had Cardboard viewers. One pulled out a phone and loaded one of the demos. Seeing someone **in the room** experiencing VR they could build themselves was the aha moment.

The combination of accessibility (web + Cardboard) and simplicity (HTML-based syntax) made VR feel achievable, not aspirational. That's what I wanted — to lower the barrier and invite people to experiment.

Virtual reality doesn't have to be expensive or exclusive. The web democratizes access. A-Frame makes creation approachable. Anyone with a browser can experience VR. Anyone with basic web skills can build it.

That's the power of WebVR — not just immersive experiences, but **accessible** immersive experiences. VR for everyone, built with the tools we already know.
