I gave this talk at the Universidad de Caldas (Manizales), outside Pereira. The goal was to introduce blockchain from the ground up: its origins in relation to the history of money and the economy, its potential applications as a major technological revolution, and how to build applications that consume blockchain-based services from JavaScript.

## What I Covered

- **Origins and context** — How blockchain relates to the history of money and economic systems
- **The technology** — What blockchain is, how it works, and why it's considered a revolution
- **Practical applications** — Beyond cryptocurrencies: use cases and possibilities
- **Building with JavaScript** — How to create apps that interact with blockchain services

It was a great opportunity to bring the topic to another university and connect with a different tech community.
