**AI Rebirth** is about the awakening of artificial intelligence — and why we're at the start of something real. I didn't want to give a generic overview. I wanted to share what I was actually seeing: a revolution that had just woken up. Something I was living every day at DailyBot.

## Why I Chose This Topic

I had three goals in mind: understand the **state of the art** of AI, explore its **possibilities**, and answer a question that kept coming up — *why should we be learning AI right now?* At DailyBot we were already building with these tools. I could feel the shift. I wanted the audience to see what I saw: we're not in a hype bubble. We're at the start of something real, and I wanted them to feel that too.

## From AI Winter to the Generative Boom

I walked them through the history — the part that still surprises me when I look back. **Deep learning** had been around for years. ImageNet, computer vision, style transfer. Then came what some call the **AI winter**: a long stretch where progress felt slow, almost stuck. But in **2022**, everything changed. **Generative AI** exploded.

GPT-2 (2019), GPT-3 (2020), DALL·E, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E 2, Stable Diffusion, BLOOM, Whisper. Each release felt like a step up. I remember when **ChatGPT** landed in November 2022. In months it reached 100 million users. It could write code, answer questions, generate SQL from natural language. Startups were being built on top of it overnight. I was watching it happen from the inside.

## GPT-4 and the Multimodal Shift

**GPT-4** had just launched. It was multimodal — it could understand images, not just text. Cheaper, 32K tokens. Microsoft was integrating Copilot into Outlook, PowerPoint, Word, Teams. Google announced PaLM 2, Bard, and Duet AI across Gmail, Docs, and Sheets. The future of work was being rewritten in real time, and we were part of it.

I also showed what was coming: **synthetic audio** — including a demo with my own cloned voice, which still feels a bit surreal — **text-to-video** tools, **AutoGPT** for autonomous agents. The message I wanted to leave: this is not the end. It's the beginning. And we get to decide how we show up for it.

## What This Means for Us

I ended with two words: **transformation** and **opportunity**. The tools are here. The APIs are open. The question isn't whether AI will change how we build — it already is. The question is whether we'll be part of it. I hope some of them felt the same thing I did.
