In November 2018 I gave the closing talk at Django Girls Pereira. Django Girls is a workshop that introduces women to programming through Python and Django. The event was organized by [Monoku](https://monoku.com/) and [Rocka](https://rocka.co/), and I was honored to close it with a talk on why Python, why programming, and what comes next.

**Why Python?** It's friendly for beginners. The syntax is simple — easy to read and write compared to other languages. It's mature — 28 years of existence have made it solid. It's versatile: APIs, IoT, data science, automation. There's high demand for Python developers. And it has a great community — Python Pereira, Python Colombia, Django Girls.

## The Road Ahead

The path is just beginning. I showed a demo of machine learning and facial recognition ([Facial Recognition with TensorFlow](https://github.com/GudarJs/Facial-Recognition-Tensorflow)) — a glimpse of what's possible: automation, fault detection, image classification. From "perro" and "gato" to building real applications.
