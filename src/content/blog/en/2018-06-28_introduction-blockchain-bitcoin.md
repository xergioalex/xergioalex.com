In June 2018 I gave a talk on the introduction and history of blockchain and Bitcoin. The goal was to go back to the origins: why we exchange value, how trust evolved, and why the 2008 financial crisis created the conditions for Bitcoin.

**History of money:** From barter to gold (scarce, durable, beautiful) to goldsmiths becoming bankers as intermediaries of trust, to paper money as a backing of that trust, to global commerce and the centralized trust model. The 2008 crisis — corruption in financial systems, the housing bubble collapse — shook that model. In 2009, a movement concerned with privacy began working on cryptographic systems. The result: a distributed trust network for exchanging goods and services without intermediaries.

## Bitcoin Characteristics

Transactions are irreversible. You don't need to reveal your identity — privacy is preserved. The money is 100% yours; it can't be frozen or seized. It doesn't belong to any state or country. No intermediaries. It's distributed. Counterfeiting and duplication are impossible thanks to cryptography.

## Blockchain in Action

Blockchain combines P2P networks, cryptography, and block-based storage. I walked through a simple example: Maria transfers 0.1 Bitcoin to Pepito. The ledger updates. Everyone can verify. No bank in the middle.

## Ethereum and Smart Contracts

Ethereum is a blockchain with a programming language for smart contracts — self-executing, transparent, automated logic. Solidity is object-oriented, inspired by JavaScript. The applications go beyond currency: DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, supply chain, identity.
