How to find Product Market Fit — I wanted to share my own story, not a generic lecture. The products I helped build at [Rocka.co](https://rocka.co), the ones that didn't work, and the one that finally did. What I learned along the way.

## What Product Market Fit Means to Me

For me, Product Market Fit happens when I feel the market is giving me enough signals that there's a real connection between what I'm building and what people need. It's that moment when the Venn diagram overlaps: my **Product** meets the **Market** and I get **Fit**.

It's not something you can calculate. It's a feeling — backed by retention, growth, people telling their friends. I've learned to recognize it when I see it. Getting there is the hard part.

## How I Learned to Iterate

The only way I've found to get closer to PMF is to iterate. Build, ship, learn, repeat. At Rocka we built many products over the years. Some of the projects that passed through my hands: [Bootstrup.com](https://bootstrup.com), [Club Kechef](https://clubkechef.com), [Lanzador](https://lanzador.co), [Neurocicla](https://neurocicla.com), [Moli Market](https://molimarket.com), [KidTrix](https://kidtrix.com), [Bambú Meditación](https://appbambu.com). Each one was a bet. Each one taught me something.

I also got involved in communities like **PereiraJS**, **Pereira Tech Talks**, and **Python Pereira**. Those spaces shaped how I think about building in public and learning from feedback. They're part of my story too.

## DailyBot: The One That Finally Fit

DailyBot wasn't born from a master plan. It was born in an **internal Hackathon** at Rocka. The idea: an AI assistant for work automation — **in-chat automation for work**. We built it, we tested it, and this time it stuck. After so many attempts, DailyBot became the product that found traction.

What made the difference? We were solving a problem we lived every day. Teams drowning in chat, repetitive tasks, constant context switching. I could feel the market signals: people started using it, sharing it, asking for more. That's when I knew we had something.

## Y Combinator: We Applied 3 Times

We didn't get into Y Combinator on the first try. **We applied 3 times**. Each application was an iteration for me: better pitch, better product, better understanding of what YC was looking for. In 2022 DailyBot was recognized as one of [Y Combinator's Top Companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/dailybot).

In the talk I shared my process: how we prepared the pitch, what I learned with each application, and why I believe persistence — along with a product that solves a real problem — ends up opening doors.
