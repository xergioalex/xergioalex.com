Blockchain is essentially a technology that provides a novel way to record and transfer information transparently and securely. It is the foundation on which cryptocurrencies operate, such as the popular [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), which have generated great controversy in recent years, gradually pushing us toward a major monetary revolution and presenting themselves as a sincere and reliable alternative to the traditional financial system. But to understand and contextualize how blockchain is playing an important role in the economy, it is necessary to know the origins and workings of money.

## 1. History of Money

Since humanity has had use of reason, it has needed to carry out exchanges. The most basic model consists of subject A, who wants object x owned by subject B, proposing an exchange for object y, seeking to reach an agreement that may be accepted or rejected by subject B depending on how fair the offer is.

![Example of basic exchange model](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-1.webp)

But this exchange model presents a great difficulty in establishing what a fair offer is, because it is complicated to determine equivalences between heterogeneous objects.

As a solution to this problem, gold emerged as a reference for exchange—a natural resource that quickly became highly prized for being an attractive, shiny material with no signs of wear and, above all, scarce, which makes it valuable.

![Gold as a reference for exchange](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-2.webp)

As an example, we will borrow from the movie [The Contestant](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447907/) the case where a farmer wants to exchange eggs for a horse. But as was already made clear, it is difficult to establish the equivalence relationship between these two heterogeneous objects, the horse being much more valuable.

![Case study of basic exchange with gold](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-3.webp)

If we look at figure 3, thanks to gold as a reference for exchange and market dynamics, it has been established that one gold nugget equals one comb of eggs, while a horse equals 10 gold nuggets, which will allow us through a simple rule of three to reach the final result where 120 eggs equal one horse.

![Result of the case study conversion](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-4.webp)

Therefore, gold becomes a universal means of conversion for exchanging any type of product or service, establishing at the same time the concept of [currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency).

However, although the adoption of the precious metal as currency represented a solid solution to the exchange problem, it also brought with it another great inconvenience related to its weight, making its transport and storage complex tasks. One only has to imagine people with resources carrying out transactions of goods and services with sacks or cartloads full of gold, making the task inefficient and insecure.

In search of a solution, owners began to leave the precious metal in the custody of goldsmiths, who charged a small commission for storing and protecting the gold and gave their respective owners a receipt written on paper as backing for their obligations.

Quickly the demand for the service grew thanks to the great trust granted by depositors. So much so that exchanges began to be made with the same deposit receipts, which later allowed an evolution of money toward the concept of [paper money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_money).

!["Gold pesos" in paper money was a reference to its backing against gold](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-5.webp)

A little later, goldsmiths discovered that it was not necessary to have all the deposited gold in their vaults to make loans, as long as depositors had enough confidence that they could convert their deposit receipts into specie. This allowed them to issue receipts for a value higher than what they had in custody, giving rise to the concept of [fractional reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_banking), and goldsmiths beyond being simple guardians became bankers.

In a short time, banks evolved from being simple intermediaries of monetary traffic to intermediaries of credit operations, moving away from the gold-backed model to a backing based on the faith and trust of the community in a promise of payment by the issuing entity.

## 2. Trust Intermediaries

![Global commerce](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-6.webp)

Banks and other financial entities become essential within the needs of globalized commerce, serving as intermediaries to transact with unknown people or organizations, where all risk is assumed by the financial entity as a trusted third party, which naturally leads to an increase in transaction costs.

![Centralized trust model](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-7.webp)

A vital dependency is then created between depositors and lenders with financial entities, submerging the economy within a centralized trust model, which becomes inevitably necessary. On the other hand, a central power medium, viewed from a technical standpoint, will always be susceptible to failures and malicious attacks, which from a financial perspective translate into corruption and bad intentions. Therefore, there will always be a small percentage of acceptable and unavoidable fraud.

![2008 mortgage crisis on Wall Street](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-8.webp)

In [2008 a great crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis) hit Wall Street due to the greed and arrogant management of mortgage bonds, submerging the world in a great recession. Financial giants like [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers) went bankrupt and many others needed bailouts to avoid it, causing a complete collapse and deterioration of trust. Even companies like General Electric had difficulty finding the necessary funds to stay in operation, demonstrating the problems present in centralized power management.

## 3. Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

The bad taste left by the ill-intentioned actions of those who hold power in financial systems led various thinkers to explore ideas about how to create an alternative exchange system without central dependency, so that no one could obtain an unfair competitive advantage. This movement became known as the [Cypherpunks](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html), who in their great concern for privacy had been working for a long time on systems based on cryptography, but none of their ideas had gone beyond paper.

![Representative figures of the Cypherpunks, from the documentary Banking on Bitcoin](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-9.webp)

On October 31, 2008, based on the ideas of the Cypherpunks and in response to the mortgage crisis on Wall Street, an anonymous user published the famous [Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, whose identity remains completely unknown to this day (2019), although much has been investigated and some figures like [Craig Steven Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright) have claimed to be Nakamoto.

In the paper, Satoshi describes how to build a purely electronic version of cash to exchange goods and services without the intermediation of a financial institution. Shortly after, Satoshi managed to create the first practical implementation of Bitcoin with the help of collaborators like [Hal Finney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Finney_(computer_scientist)), with whom on January 11, 2009 he carried out the [first transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16), sending him 10 BTC to test the correct functioning of the network (at the time of publication of this article, 10 years have passed since the first Bitcoin transfer).

![Photo of the first two pizzas bought with bitcoins](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-10.webp)

Bitcoin's popularity grew rapidly among enthusiasts, but in practice it had little value. Tired of this, on May 22, 2010 a developer known as Lazlo Hanyecz [posted on a Bitcoin forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0) that he would be willing to pay 10,000 BTC to whoever brought two delicious pizzas to his house. To everyone's surprise, a stranger accepted the offer and they closed the deal, which would go down in history as the [first practical transaction](https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/cca7507897abc89628f450e8b1e0c6fca4ec3f7b34cccf55f3f531c659ff4d79) on the network—and one of the most expensive if we consider that today (2019) a single Bitcoin costs around three to five thousand USD, reaching the surprising peak of almost 20,000 USD at the end of 2017.

![Bitcoin price from January 2009 to present (2019), from coinmarketcap](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-11.webp)

Bitcoin then becomes a reliable and cheap means for the exchange of value worldwide, standing out as one of its strong points the ability to avoid the large commissions that normally imply transacting through traditional intermediaries. It should also be clarified that the cryptocurrency has in the past been in trouble maintaining this characteristic, because as the first implementation it was not yet ready to support the incredible load and scale that the network has achieved, implying as a consequence high transaction costs. But recently thanks to a new scaling solution implemented in it known as [Lightning Networks](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf), the performance and speed of the network have been considerably improved, allowing again to have almost instant transactions at an almost negligible cost.

![Bitcoin as a global exchange network](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-12.webp)

Among other important characteristics of Bitcoin, the following can be highlighted:

- **Security**: It is impossible to counterfeit or duplicate, thanks to a sophisticated cryptography system.
- **Distributed / decentralized system**: Moving away from the centralized model, whose defects have already been exposed previously, Bitcoin is sustained under a distributed peer network in charge of validating and maintaining the security and consistency of the data and records stored in the blockchain. Although it should be clarified that today the Bitcoin network is considered more a decentralized than distributed network because participating mining nodes increasingly require higher processing capabilities, relegating the rest to being simple clients or consumers of the network.
- **No intermediaries**: Although dispensing with trusted third parties is one of the essential premises of Bitcoin, it is important to note that this intermediation work does not disappear completely and is replaced by a large network of anonymous peers who are in charge of validating transactions through [proof of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work), a concept that will be addressed later.
- **No central power**: It does not belong to any state or country and can be used equally throughout the world.
- **Strong ownership control**: The money belongs 100% to its owner; it cannot be intervened by anyone else, nor can accounts be canceled.
- **Irreversible transactions**: Essential characteristic to prevent the [double spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending) problem, which is a potential defect that allows a digital token to be spent more than once.
- **Anonymous transactions**: It is not necessary to reveal identity to do business, preserving privacy.

## 4. What is Blockchain and How Does It Work?

We already know what Bitcoin is, its characteristics and all its potential, but how does it work? Below is a more detailed description of the theory exposed by Satoshi Nakamoto about the functioning of the system.

### 4.1. The Double Spending Problem

First of all, it is important to address the [double spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending) problem, which translates into preventing a resource from being consumed more than once, just as it is not possible to spend the same bill twice at the store. This is a particular defect of electronic money, since it is easy to duplicate or falsify any digital file or data.

![Technologies that support Bitcoin](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-13.webp)

Satoshi then proposes as a solution the joint use of three essential technologies: a [distributed peer network (P2P)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer), a sophisticated [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) system, and a shared database known as Blockchain.

### 4.2. Blockchain

The Blockchain is without a doubt the key component of the solution. It is basically a shared database that stores, through a chain of blocks of digital signatures, the ownership and time record of transactions made. From now on, any mention of the Blockchain may also refer to the complete system formed by the three technologies.

![Transactions as a chain of digital signatures, from the Bitcoin paper](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-14.webp)

Each block of transactions is generated and chained sequentially and is linked to a unique and irreplaceable digital signature calculated using complex cryptographic algorithms, in such a way that it is almost impossible to falsify. Given that if we return to the double spending problem, anyone could duplicate or modify the content of transactions without this security mechanism.

The above is essential because the Blockchain must be shared within a distributed peer network (P2P), which is basically a network of computers around the world that share an exact copy of the blockchain. In such a way that this network must cooperate to maintain the integrity and security of the Blockchain and generate new transaction blocks through consensus algorithms and considerable computing investment to calculate through [proof of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) the complex cryptographic keys that link the blockchain. In the Blockchain, these mechanisms are known as Mining.

### 4.3. Mining

![Mining on the Bitcoin network](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-15.webp)

It is important to note that the entire peer network in the Blockchain functions as a government bound by strict rules that each of the nodes joined to it must comply with, with the difference that there is no central node or computer that has control to make decisions above the others. But such cooperation is impossible without some kind of [incentive](https://bitcoin.org/files/bitcoin-paper/bitcoin_es.pdf) for participating nodes.

Each block of transactions in a Bitcoin mining network, for example, represents a movement of money, and the generation of said block, as mentioned before, requires proof of work, which translates into significant computing investment by participating nodes, which basically enter a competition to find the cryptographic key that allows chaining the new block to the chain. Finding said key is complex due to the sophisticated implementation and cryptographic rules that govern the chain. Therefore, the node that manages to find said key first will receive an incentive, which is basically a commission that network users pay to participating nodes, from now on known as miners, for their work and effort invested.

Additionally, through consensus algorithms, the network must verify that the newly found block is valid and that the integrity of the information in the transaction has not been altered. For this, a small additional group of miners must find the same block and attest to its validity.

Satoshi introduced the concept of mining by referring to gold extraction processes, where miners must invest great effort and heavy machinery to excavate and extract gold from the earth. A process that as gold is extracted from the surface becomes more complex and costly, given that the mineral is scarce and the soil must be penetrated to greater depth each time.

The following figure illustrates the functioning of a transaction within the blockchain, where two users interact and a Bitcoin transfer is made from Maria's user to Pepito. The number in blue refers to the consecutive block number throughout the entire chain:

![Blockchain in action on a Bitcoin network](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-16.webp)

### 4.4. Ethereum: Blockchain Applications Platform

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency that emerged in early 2014 using the initial Bitcoin implementation as a base. Its creator [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) implemented an additional layer that allowed the incorporation of smart contracts, which basically aimed to automate the occurrence of a transaction based on conditions previously defined through programming code, allowing value transactions in a transparent, secure and 100% automatable way.

![Smart Contract](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-17.webp)

The smart contract then allows executing agreements established between two or more parties, controlling whether or not a transaction occurs based on the result of compliance with a series of specific conditions previously programmed.

The potential of smart contracts is enormous, providing a means to interact with the blockchain programmatically, giving rise to the development of applications, games and platforms using the Blockchain as a database. These applications are known as Ðapps (Decentralized Application).

## 5. Blockchain: The Industrial Revolution of the Internet Beyond Bitcoin

Summarizing from a purely technical aspect, the Blockchain is nothing more than a shared database in a community made up of multiple computers (miners) that cooperate with each other using complex security and consensus mechanisms to maintain its integrity. And transaction blocks are records that can contain any type of information.

Ðapps take advantage of the full potential of Blockchain technology, allowing the development of disruptive applications that can belong to different areas than the financial sector, understanding that for the first time without the need for a trusted third party it is possible to transfer a piece of digital property through the internet with an almost irrefutable guarantee of being secure, where anyone can find out that the transfer occurred without doubting its legitimacy. Below are some of the most outstanding applications:

### 5.1. Distributed Cloud Storage

As an alternative to cloud storage services like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), some Blockchain-based projects have emerged like [StorJ](https://storj.io/), where files are not stored in large datacenters of private companies, but are distributed in a large network of participating nodes that rent their free storage space in exchange for an incentive that the platform pays in Ethereum tokens.

StorJ encrypts files point-to-point before sending them to nodes, so that although the information is exposed, only the owner can access it.

### 5.2. Internet of Things

![Blockchain in IoT](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-18.webp)

With the evolution of hardware, we are in a transition era where any real-world object will be able to be connected to the internet and interact with other devices. But due to the limited resources that these low-cost systems possess—such as processing, memory and power—it is difficult to implement effective and advanced security controls for the growing network of connected devices, representing a major cybersecurity problem due to the defects and security holes existing in these products due to lack of updates and support.

Blockchain presents itself as a great ally for IoT, serving as infrastructure for the intercommunication of these devices under a large trust network, ensuring the integrity and point-to-point communication of data. On the other hand, thanks to smart contracts, it is possible to give each device a unique digital identity and provide the means for the automation of interactions.

### 5.3. Electronic Voting Systems

![Blockchain-based electronic voting system](/images/blog/posts/blockchain-economy-industry/fig-19.webp)

Electoral fraud is one of the greatest problems that exist worldwide, with highly negative consequences for any society that considers itself democratic. Many mechanisms such as electronic voting have been proposed and implemented in some countries to guarantee the transparency and legitimacy of the vote, allowing automation, acceleration and real-time access to the vote count for all participants. But being an electronic system, it can be easily breached and attacked.

Being transparency a fundamental pillar of blockchain technology, it is possible to implement highly secure and practically inviolable electronic voting systems. Some outstanding projects working on this type of mechanism are: [Polys](https://polys.me/), [Secure Vote](https://secure.vote/), [Voatz](https://voatz.com/).

### 5.4. Gambling

The use of cryptocurrencies in the gambling industry brings great advantages for casinos, allowing the user to play anonymously, without the need to create an account or depend on the platform, allowing the use of a private, cheap, legal and accessible system.

On the other hand, thanks to the benefits of smart contracts, bets can be programmed and automated, allowing almost instant deposits and fairer distributions.

### 5.5. Digital and Automated Notary

Smart contracts would in the future replace notaries, avoiding the cost of intermediation and bureaucratic delays by third parties. Allowing a reliable and immutable public record that can be audited and verified by anyone, avoiding the possible problem of manipulation or fraud that could arise to attempt some scam or legal fraud.

### 5.6. Unique Identity Registry

The current identity system based on passwords for authentication in online systems is highly insecure and implies a set of different credentials on each platform. Through Blockchain it is possible to create a unique digital fingerprint and use the network as a decentralized source of authentication for all systems.

This mechanism would also serve to replace identity cards, providing a means that allows validating worldwide that a person is who they say they are and registering with said ID in a transparent manner all their properties in a public and reliable registry.

### 5.7. Decentralized Medical History

Linked to the use of a unique identity registry in the health sector, the blockchain infrastructure could be used to store a person's clinical data and history, to be shared and read by any doctor globally with total certainty of its integrity. On the other hand, the patient would be totally owner of their data and not the hospital entities.

### 5.8. Tracking and Tracing

As a complement to the unique identity registry applied to any industry—whether financial, hospital, legal, technological, hotel, transportation or others—the security of the blockchain makes it possible to track and verify the status of any property over time. For example, in the real estate sector it would allow knowing who is the owner of a property and knowing a history of all previous owners; as well as it would be possible to verify and trace the origin of a jewel, allowing to combat the blood diamond trade; or avoid counterfeiting in the area of intellectual property, allowing to efficiently verify the ownership of artistic works.
