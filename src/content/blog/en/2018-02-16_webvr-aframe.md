We resumed activities with a strong turnout and two talks: me on WebVR with A-Frame, and Alejandro Suárez on point-free JavaScript with RamdaJS. I focused on bringing virtual reality to the web — making immersive 360° experiences accessible to everyone.

The web is the most important mass-distribution platform. A-Frame, an open-source framework by Mozilla, lets you create 3D and VR content with HTML — no build step required. It works with most existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks: React, Angular, D3.js, Vue.js, and more.

## What I Covered

- **A-Frame** — Creating 3D and VR with HTML
- **Components and inspector** — Building virtual environments with A-Frame's components and its web inspector (which feels like working with Unity)
- **First steps** — From zero to your first VR scene
