That night at PereiraJs we had two talks: Julian Patiño on mobile development with Ionic + Angular, and me on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I focused on making the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum accessible — and closed with a demo using Solidity for smart contracts.

The idea was to answer: *How does Bitcoin work?* From there, I explained blockchain as the underlying technology, then moved to Ethereum and its smart contracts — self-executing code on the chain. The Solidity demo showed how to write and deploy a simple contract.
