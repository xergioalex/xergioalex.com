Blockchain and cryptocurrencies — making the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum accessible, and a live demo using Solidity for smart contracts.

The idea was to answer: *How does Bitcoin work?* From there, I explained blockchain as the underlying technology, then moved to Ethereum and its smart contracts — self-executing code on the chain. The demo showed how to write and deploy a simple contract.
