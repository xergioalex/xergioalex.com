The [Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper) by Satoshi Nakamoto — a walk through the history of money, the centralized trust model, and how Satoshi's paper proposes an alternative.

## History: From Barter to Paper Money

I started with the exchange of objects — the most basic barter model. Gold emerges as a reference for exchange: it's attractive, it shines, it doesn't wear, and it's scarce. It becomes currency. But transporting it is complex.

Goldsmiths custody the gold and issue receipts. Those receipts start circulating — **paper money** is born as a backing of trust. Goldsmiths become bankers. Global commerce depends on intermediaries that assume risk: banks, notaries, platforms. We operate under a **centralized trust model**.

## The 2008 Crisis and the Cypherpunk Movement

In 2008, corruption in financial systems — the collapse of the housing bubble — exposed the weaknesses of that model. In 2009, a movement concerned with privacy that had been working on cryptography-based systems emerged.

The idea: a **distributed network of trust** for the exchange of goods and services **without intermediaries**.

## Bitcoin Characteristics

In the paper, Satoshi describes a system where:

- Transactions are **irreversible**
- You don't need to reveal your identity — it preserves privacy
- The money belongs to you 100%; it can't be seized nor can accounts be frozen
- It doesn't belong to any state; it can be used worldwide
- **There are no intermediaries**. It's **distributed**
- It's impossible to counterfeit or duplicate thanks to cryptography

## Blockchain: P2P + Cryptography + Blocks

Blockchain combines three elements:

- **Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks**
- **Cryptography**
- **Block-based storage system**

Each transaction is recorded in chained blocks. Distributed consensus replaces the trust intermediary.

## Ethereum and Smart Contracts

I also talked about [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) — a blockchain with an integrated programming language for **smart contracts**. [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/), influenced by JavaScript, lets you write contracts that execute value transactions in a transparent, secure, and automatable way.
