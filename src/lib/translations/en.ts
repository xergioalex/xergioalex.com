We\u2019d all been part of PereiraJS and Python Pereira, but we wanted something bigger \u2014 a community that brought everyone together regardless of their stack.<br /><br />That conversation became Pereira Tech Talks. What started as small meetups in borrowed spaces has grown into one of the most active tech communities in Colombia. We\u2019ve filled auditoriums at UTP, brought in speakers from across Latin America, and watched countless developers give their first public talk. The best part? Seeing people who came as attendees return months later as speakers, closing the knowledge-sharing loop.',
