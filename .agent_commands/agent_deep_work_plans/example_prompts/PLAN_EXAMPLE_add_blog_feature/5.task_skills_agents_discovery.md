# Task 5: Skills & Agents Discovery

## 1. Context

**Purpose:** This is a mandatory task in every Deep Work Plan. It evaluates whether the work completed during this plan has created new patterns, components, workflows, or architectural structures that would benefit from becoming reusable Skills or Agents.

**Where:**
- Skills catalog: `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`
- Skills directory: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- Agents directory: `.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md`
- Skills generator: `.agent_commands/agent_skills_generator/`

**Dependencies:** ALL previous user-defined tasks (1-4) must be completed.

## 2. Read Before Starting

- Task 1-4 Completion & Logs: Note any new patterns or components created

## 3. Goal

Evaluate all work completed during this plan and determine if new Skills or Agents should be created, or if existing ones need updates. "No changes needed" is a valid outcome.

## 4. Instructions

> **Before starting:** Re-read the plan README section 1 (Goal) to ensure this task's work aligns with the overall objective.

### Step 1: Review all completed tasks
Read every completed task's Completion & Log.

### Step 2: Check existing catalog
Read `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`.

### Step 3: Evaluate for NEW skills/agents

| Pattern | Repeatable? | Existing Coverage? | Candidate? | Type | Rationale |
|---------|:-----------:|:------------------:|:----------:|:----:|-----------|
| {pattern} | Yes/No | Yes ({name}) / No | Yes/No | Skill/Agent/— | {why} |

### Step 4: Evaluate EXISTING skills/agents for updates

| Skill/Agent | Update Needed? | What Changed | Proposed Update |
|-------------|:--------------:|-------------|-----------------|
| {name} | Yes/No | {what changed} | {specific update} |

### Step 5: Evaluate skills generator system

| Aspect | Improvement Needed? | Proposed Change |

| GUIDE content | Yes/No | {describe} |
| Skill template | Yes/No | {describe} |

### Step 6: Implement changes (or document "no changes needed")
