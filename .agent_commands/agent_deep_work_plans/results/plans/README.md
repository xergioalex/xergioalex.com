# Plans - Execution Workspace

This folder is **git-ignored** and contains temporary execution plans generated by agents.

---

## Purpose

This folder stores:

- ✅ **Generated deep work plans** created by agents
- ✅ **Execution artifacts** (task files, completion logs)
- ✅ **Temporary work** that shouldn't clutter the repository

---

## Structure

When an agent creates a plan, it will generate this structure:

```
plans/
├── README.md                           # This file
├── .gitkeep                            # Keeps folder in git
└── PLAN_{plan_name}/                   # Generated by agent
    ├── README.md                       # Plan overview and task list
    ├── PROMPTS.md                      # Ready-to-use prompts
    ├── PROGRESS.md                     # Running progress summary
    ├── analysis_results/               # Analysis outputs & reports
    │   └── EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md        # Generated by mandatory final task
    ├── 1.task_{task_title}.md          # Task 1 with instructions
    ├── 2.task_{task_title}.md          # Task 2 with instructions
    ├── ...
    ├── N-1.task_skills_agents_discovery.md  # MANDATORY: second-to-last
    └── N.task_executive_report.md           # MANDATORY: final task
```

## Lifecycle

### 1. **Creation**

Agent creates a plan based on your prompt:

```
.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PLAN_ui_expansion/
```

### 2. **Execution**

Agent works through tasks sequentially:

- Marks tasks as `[x]` when complete
- Updates completion logs
- Commits after each task

### 3. **Completion**

All tasks finished - plan is complete!

### 4. **Cleanup**

After work is merged, you can delete the plan folder:

```bash
rm -rf .agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PLAN_ui_expansion/
```

---

## Git Ignore

### ✅ **Committed to git:**

- `plans/README.md` (this file)
- `plans/.gitkeep` (keeps folder)

### ❌ **Ignored by git:**

- `plans/PLAN_*/` (all plan folders)
- All generated plan content

---

## Why Git-Ignored?

Plans are **temporary execution artifacts**, not permanent repository content:

- 🚀 **Disposable** - Delete after merge
- 📝 **Execution-specific** - Tied to specific work sessions
- 🔄 **Regenerable** - Can be recreated from prompts
- 🧹 **Keep repo clean** - Avoid clutter in version history

- **`example_prompts/`** - Copy-paste ready prompts for creating plans
- **`prompt_drafts/`** - Your workspace for drafting prompts before execution
- **`plans/`** - This folder - where executed plans live (temporarily)

---

**This folder is managed by agents during execution. You typically don't need to create files here manually.**
