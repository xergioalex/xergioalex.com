# Task 10: Skills & Agents Discovery

## 1. Context

**Purpose:** This is a mandatory task in every Deep Work Plan. It evaluates whether the work completed during this plan has created new patterns, components, workflows, or architectural structures that would benefit from becoming reusable Skills or Agents. It also evaluates whether existing skills/agents need updates and whether the skills generator system itself needs improvements.

**Why this matters:**
- New patterns created during plans are prime candidates for reusable recipes
- Existing skills/agents may need updates to reflect changes made during the plan
- The skills generator system itself may benefit from improvements
- This creates a virtuous cycle: plans → skills → better plans → better skills

**Where:**
- Skills catalog: `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`
- Skills directory: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- Agents directory: `.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md`
- Skills generator: `.agent_commands/agent_skills_generator/`

**Dependencies:** ALL previous user-defined tasks (1-9) must be completed.

## 2. Goal

Evaluate all work completed during this plan and: (1) determine if new Skills or Agents should be created, (2) determine if existing Skills or Agents need updates, (3) evaluate if the skills generator system needs improvements. If changes are warranted, implement them. "No changes needed" is a valid outcome.

## 3. Instructions

> **Before starting:** Re-read the plan README section 1 (Goal) to ensure this task's work aligns with the overall objective.

### Step 1: Review all completed tasks
Read every completed task's Completion & Log. Note new patterns, structures, components, procedures, and validation expertise.

### Step 2: Check existing catalog
Read `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md` to understand what already exists.

### Step 3: Evaluate for NEW skills/agents

**Create a SKILL when:** A new repeatable, specific procedure was established that will be needed again.
**Create an AGENT when:** New specialized validation/review expertise was needed that applies to future work.
**Do NOT create when:** Work is one-off, existing skills cover it, pattern is too generic, or too project-specific.

| Pattern | Repeatable? | Existing Coverage? | Candidate? | Type | Rationale |
|---------|:-----------:|:------------------:|:----------:|:----:|-----------|
| {pattern} | Yes/No | Yes ({name}) / No | Yes/No | Skill/Agent/— | {why} |

### Step 4: Evaluate EXISTING skills/agents for updates

| Skill/Agent | Update Needed? | What Changed | Proposed Update |
|-------------|:--------------:|-------------|-----------------|
| `write-tests` | Check | Testing is now configured with Vitest | May need Vitest-specific patterns |
| {name} | Yes/No | {what the plan changed} | {specific update} |

### Step 5: Evaluate skills generator system

Read `.agent_commands/agent_skills_generator/GUIDE_TO_CREATE_SKILLS_AND_AGENTS.md` and templates. Assess:

| Aspect | Improvement Needed? | Proposed Change |
|--------|:-------------------:|-----------------|
| GUIDE content | Yes/No | {describe} |
| Skill template | Yes/No | {describe} |
| Agent template | Yes/No | {describe} |
| Catalog format | Yes/No | {describe} |

### Step 6: Implement changes
- Create new skills using `.agent_commands/agent_skills_generator/templates/SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`
- Create new agents using `.agent_commands/agent_skills_generator/templates/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`
- Update existing skills/agents (add to Changelog section)
- Apply generator improvements if identified
- Update catalog for all changes

### Step 7: Handle "no changes needed"
If nothing warrants changes, document the evaluation results and move on.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All completed tasks reviewed
- [ ] Existing catalog checked
- [ ] New pattern evaluation completed
- [ ] Existing skills/agents evaluated for updates
- [ ] Skills generator system evaluated
- [ ] Changes implemented (or "no changes needed" documented)
- [ ] Catalog updated if any changes made

## 5. Validation

Verify: evaluation tables are filled, any new files follow templates, catalog is consistent.

## 6. Execution Checklist

- [ ] Read all completed task Completion & Logs
- [ ] Read existing catalog
- [ ] Evaluate new patterns
- [ ] Evaluate existing skills/agents for updates
- [ ] Evaluate skills generator system
- [ ] Implement changes (or document "no changes needed")
- [ ] Update catalog
- [ ] Update plan README `[x]`
- [ ] Update PROGRESS.md
- [ ] Commit
- [ ] Update log below

## 7. Completion & Log

**Status:** Completed

- Patterns evaluated: Vitest setup, astro:content mocking, Svelte 5 browser conditions, deep key extraction for translations
- New skills created: None needed (patterns are project-specific, not repeatable as new skills)
- New agents created: None needed
- Existing skills updated: `write-tests` — updated from placeholder to actual Vitest setup with real patterns, config details, Svelte 5 notes
- Existing agents updated: None needed
- Generator improvements: None needed
- Catalog updated: No (write-tests description already accurate in catalog)

### Evaluation Tables

**New patterns evaluation:**

| Pattern | Repeatable? | Existing Coverage? | Candidate? | Type | Rationale |
|---------|:-----------:|:------------------:|:----------:|:----:|-----------|
| Vitest + happy-dom + Svelte 5 setup | Yes | Yes (write-tests) | No | — | Covered by updated write-tests skill |
| astro:content mock for Vitest | Yes | Yes (write-tests) | No | — | Documented in write-tests skill |
| Deep key extraction for translation parity | No | No | No | — | One-off structural test, not a repeatable procedure |
| Browser resolve condition for Svelte 5 | Yes | Yes (write-tests) | No | — | Documented in write-tests and TESTING_GUIDE |

**Existing skills/agents evaluation:**

| Skill/Agent | Update Needed? | What Changed | Proposed Update |
|-------------|:--------------:|-------------|-----------------|
| write-tests | Yes | Testing is now configured with Vitest | Updated: removed "NOT CONFIGURED", added real setup details |
| reviewer | No | No changes to review process | — |
| Other skills | No | No impact from testing setup | — |

**Skills generator evaluation:**

| Aspect | Improvement Needed? | Proposed Change |
|--------|:-------------------:|-----------------|
| GUIDE content | No | — |
| Skill template | No | — |
| Agent template | No | — |
| Catalog format | No | — |
