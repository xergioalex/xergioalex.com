# Task 11: Executive Report

## 1. Context

**Purpose:** This is the mandatory final task of every Deep Work Plan. It generates a comprehensive Executive Report summarizing everything accomplished, written for cross-functional consumption (Product, Engineering, QA, Stakeholders).

**Where:**
- Output: `analysis_results/EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md`
- Input: All completed tasks' Completion & Log sections

**Dependencies:** ALL previous tasks must be completed.

## 2. Goal

Generate `analysis_results/EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md` — a comprehensive, multi-audience report.

## 3. Instructions

> **Before starting:** Re-read the plan README section 1 (Goal).

### Step 1: Gather information from all completed tasks
Read every Completion & Log. Extract: what was done, files changed, decisions made, validation results, blockers.

### Step 2: Gather additional context
Read plan README. Review `git log` for commits. Check `analysis_results/` for other reports. Check `PROGRESS.md` for running summary.

### Step 3: Write the Executive Report

Create `analysis_results/EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Executive Report: Implement Unit Testing Infrastructure

**Plan:** `PLAN_implement_unit_tests`
**Date:** {date}
**Tasks Completed:** {completed}/{total}
**Status:** {Completed | Partially Completed}

## 1. Executive Summary
{2-3 paragraphs, no jargon, focus on "so what"}

## 2. Product Impact
### Changes Delivered
### Business Value

## 3. Technical Details
### Implementation Summary
### Code Quality & Testing
### Files Changed
### Key Decisions & Trade-offs

## 4. QA Verification Guide
### How to Verify Changes
### Known Limitations & Edge Cases

## 5. FAQs (if non-obvious)

## 6. Next Steps & Recommendations
### Immediate Follow-ups
### Future Considerations
```

### Step 4: Adapt based on plan type
This is a **code/testing plan** — emphasize:
- Technical details (coverage numbers, test counts, configuration choices)
- QA section (how to run tests, what they cover, what they don't)
- Next steps (E2E tests, additional coverage, CI integration)

### Step 5: Review
Re-read from PM, QA, and developer perspectives. No section should be empty.
