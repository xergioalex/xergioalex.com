# Task 1: Create src/README.md

## Context

The `src/` folder is the main source directory containing all application code. It needs a README.md that explains the overall structure for AI agents to navigate.

## Goal

Create a comprehensive README.md for `src/` that:
- Explains the folder structure
- Describes each subdirectory's purpose
- Provides navigation guidance for AI agents
- Links to detailed documentation in each subfolder

## Instructions

2. **Create** `src/README.md` with:
   - Overview of the source folder
   - Directory structure diagram
   - Description of each folder (components, content, layouts, lib, pages, styles)
   - Quick start guide for common tasks
   - Links to subfolder READMEs (note: will be created in subsequent tasks)
   - Links to related docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, STANDARDS.md)

- [ ] `src/README.md` exists
- [ ] Contains clear structure overview
- [ ] Describes all subfolders
