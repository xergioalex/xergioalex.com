# Task 7: Update refactor-safe Skill

## Context

## Goal

Update `.claude/skills/refactor-safe/SKILL.md` with Astro refactoring patterns.

## Instructions

2. **Update** refactoring patterns for:
   - Astro component extraction
   - Svelte component extraction
   - Moving files between folders
   - Updating imports with aliases (`@/`)
   - Extracting utilities to `src/lib/`
3. **Update** validation:
   - `npm run biome:check`
   - `npm run astro:check`
   - `npm run build`
4. **Update** examples:
   - Extract common code to component
   - Move component to different folder
   - Rename and update imports

## Key Patterns

Safe refactors in this repo:
- Extract repeated JSX to Astro component
- Extract interactive elements to Svelte
- Move utilities to `src/lib/`
- Consolidate Tailwind classes
