# Task 9: Update write-tests Skill

## Context

The write-tests skill references Mocha. This repo will use Vitest/Playwright (not yet configured).

## Goal

Update `.claude/skills/write-tests/SKILL.md` for Vitest/Playwright.

## Instructions

1. **Read** the current skill file
2. **Remove** all Mocha references
3. **Update** for future testing setup:
   - Vitest for unit tests
   - Playwright for E2E tests
   - `*.test.ts` naming convention
4. **Note** that testing is not yet configured:
   - Add note about current status
   - Provide patterns for when tests are added
5. **Update** test patterns for:
   - Utility function tests
   - Component tests (future)
   - API endpoint tests

## Key Changes

Replace Mocha with:
```typescript
// Vitest example
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('getBlogPosts', () => {
  it('should return paginated posts', async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No Mocha references
- [ ] Vitest patterns documented
- [ ] Playwright mentioned for E2E
- [ ] Current status noted (not configured)

## Completion Log

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
