# Task 4: Update security-auditor.md Agent

## Context

The security-auditor agent has references to Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, and AWS services from the serverless repository.

## Goal

Update `.claude/agents/security-auditor.md` for static site security concerns.

## Instructions

1. **Read** the current security-auditor.md file
2. **Remove** all AWS/Lambda/DynamoDB/SNS references

   - Environment variables (if any)
   - Third-party script security
   - Content Security Policy considerations
   - XSS prevention in user-generated content
4. **Update** scope to include:
   - Build-time security (no secrets in public/)
   - Client-side security (no sensitive data exposed)
   - API endpoint validation
5. **Reference** docs/SECURITY.md for guidance
