# Task 1: Update architect.md Agent

## Context

The architect agent has references to "Lambda/botFlow patterns" from the original serverless repository.

## Goal

Update `.claude/agents/architect.md` to be fully Astro-specific.

## Instructions

1. **Remove** all serverless/Lambda references
2. **Update** the adaptation note to reference:
   - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Astro architecture)
   - docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md (product vision)
   - Astro/Svelte component patterns
3. **Update** validation commands to:
   - `npm run biome:check`
   - `npm run astro:check`
   - `npm run build`
4. **Update** scope to focus on:
   - Component architecture (Astro vs Svelte decisions)
   - Routing patterns
   - Content Collections design
   - Styling architecture (Tailwind)

## Changes Required

Replace this line:
```
Adapted for this repo: consider docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md, Lambda/botFlow patterns.
```

With:
```
Adapted for this repo: consider docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PRODUCT_SPEC.md, Astro component patterns, Tailwind styling.
```

Update validation commands from `npm run eslint:check` to `npm run biome:check`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No Lambda/serverless references
- [ ] References Astro-specific architecture
- [ ] Validation commands use Biome
- [ ] Scope includes Astro patterns
