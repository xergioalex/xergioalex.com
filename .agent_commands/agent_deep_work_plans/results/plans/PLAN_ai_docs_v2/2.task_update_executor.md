# Task 2: Update executor.md Agent

## Context

The executor agent has references to Lambda handlers and ESLint from the serverless repository.

## Goal

Update `.claude/agents/executor.md` to be fully Astro-specific.

## Instructions

1. **Read** the current executor.md file
2. **Remove** all Lambda/serverless/handler references
3. **Update** validation commands:
   - `npm run biome:check` (not eslint)
   - `npm run astro:check`
   - `npm run build`
4. **Update** execution patterns for:
   - Astro pages creation
   - Svelte component creation
   - Content Collection operations
   - Tailwind styling
5. **Update** test references:
   - Note that testing is not yet configured
   - Future: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No Lambda/serverless references
- [ ] No ESLint references (use Biome)
- [ ] Execution patterns are Astro-specific
- [ ] Test references updated for Vitest/Playwright
