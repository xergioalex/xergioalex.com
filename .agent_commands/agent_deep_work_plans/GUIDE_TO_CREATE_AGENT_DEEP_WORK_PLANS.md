# GUIDE_TO_CREATE_AGENT_DEEP_WORK_PLANS.md

### How to Create Deep-Work Task Execution Plans Under `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/`

This guide defines the **official structure and workflow** for creating _agent deep work plans_.

These plans are designed so that an AI agent (Cursor, Claude, etc.) can:

- Work for **many hours** (including overnight)
- Focus on **one task at a time**
- Follow a **clear, ordered execution plan**
- Keep everything **modular, auditable and disposable**

Use this document whenever you need to generate a new deep-work plan.

---

## 1. Top-Level Folder Structure

All deep-work plan assets live under:

```text
.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/
├─ README.md
├─ GUIDE_TO_CREATE_AGENT_DEEP_WORK_PLANS.md   ← this guide
├─ example_prompts/                           ← documentation and examples

         ├─ 1.task_{task_title}.md            ← task 1 (detailed, single-task focus)
         ├─ 2.task_{task_title}.md            ← task 2
         ├─ 3.task_{task_title}.md            ← task 3
         └─ ...
```

### 1.1. Git ignore rule

The `results/` directory (containing `drafts/` and `plans/`) is **disposable** and should be git-ignored.

Add (or ensure) in `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/*
!.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/.gitkeep
!.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/drafts/.gitkeep
!.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/drafts/README.md
!.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/.gitkeep
!.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/README.md
!.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PROMPTS_TEMPLATE.md
!.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md
```

**Important:**
Plan folders under `results/plans/` are meant for **temporary execution runs**, not permanent repository content. The stable documentation lives in `README.md`, `example_prompts/`, and this guide.

---

## 2. Naming Conventions

### 2.1. Plan folders

Each plan folder must be named:

```text
PLAN_{plan_title}
```

Where:

- `{plan_title}` is:
  - Lowercase
  - Snake case
  - Short and descriptive

**Examples:**

- `PLAN_ui_showcase_expansion`
- `PLAN_refactor_checkin_engine`
- `PLAN_docs_reorganization`
- `PLAN_ai_dev_kit_cleanups`

### 2.2. Task files

Each task file inside a plan folder is named:

```text
1.task_{task_title}.md
2.task_{task_title}.md
3.task_{task_title}.md
```

Where:

- The **numeric prefix** defines the **strict execution order**.
- `{task_title}` is a short description of the task focus.

**Examples:**

- `1.task_create_buttons_component_page.md`
- `2.task_add_integration_tests_for_checkins.md`
- `3.task_update_checkins_docs.md`

Agents must **not** change the order or numbering once created.

---

## 3. Purpose of This System

This system exists to:

- Break a large objective into **small, atomic tasks**
- Ensure the agent works on **only one task at a time**
- Provide a **plan-level overview** (`PLAN/README.md`)
- Provide **per-task deep prompts** (`N.task_*.md`)
- Support **long-running / deep-work sessions** (multi-hour / overnight)
- Avoid clutter in the main repo (plans are temporary)
- Make execution auditable and reproducible

---

## 4. Plan-Level README Structure (`PLAN_{plan_title}/README.md`)

Each plan folder must have a `README.md` that serves as the **index and control center** for the deep-work session.

### 4.1. Required sections

A plan README must contain:

1. **Plan Title and Goal**
2. **Context**
3. **Global Constraints / Guidelines**
4. **Task List (with links to task files)**
5. **Execution Rules for the Agent**
6. **Skills & Agents Used in This Plan** (see section 11)
7. **Plan Status / Notes**
8. **Quick Note:** Reference to PROMPTS.md file for ready-to-use prompts

### 4.2. Example structure

```markdown
# Plan: {Human-readable Plan Title}

## 1. Goal

Short description of the overall objective of this plan.

Example:

- Expand UI showcase docs and components.
- Refactor the Smart Check-ins engine for better maintainability.
- Improve test coverage and documentation for feature X.

## 2. Context

Provide relevant context:

- Tech stack (e.g., Astro 5.16.15, Svelte 5.48.0, TypeScript 5.9.3, Tailwind CSS 4.1.18, Biome 2.3.11).
- Where the code lives (e.g., `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/content/`).
- Any important dependencies or constraints.

## 3. Global Guidelines

Some examples:

- Always work in a feature branch, never directly on `main`.
- Use small, incremental, well-described commits.
- Run code quality checks (`npm run biome:check`, `npm run astro:check`) as specified in each task.
- Use TypeScript with type annotations where practical.
- Follow import order: Node.js native → third-party → internal (using @) → types.
- Support dark mode in all UI components (use Tailwind's `dark:` variant).
- Use Astro components for static content, Svelte for interactivity.
- Prefer clear, maintainable code over micro-optimizations.

## 4. Task List & Links

The agent must execute tasks **in order** and **one at a time**.

- [ ] Task 1: Add new blog component
      See: [1.task_add_blog_component.md](./1.task_add_blog_component.md)

- [ ] Task 2: Add component documentation
      See: [2.task_add_component_docs.md](./2.task_add_component_docs.md)

- [ ] Task 3: Update architecture documentation
      See: [3.task_update_architecture_docs.md](./3.task_update_architecture_docs.md)

> **Agent rule:** Always work on the first unchecked `[ ]` task, and only move to the next after fully completing it.

## 5. Execution Rules for the Agent

- Work strictly in the order defined in the Task List.
- Focus on **one task file at a time**.
- Do not skip or reorder tasks.
- For each task:
  - Open the corresponding `N.task_*.md`.
  - Follow the detailed instructions carefully.
  - If the task references a skill file, read and follow the skill's procedure.
  - Run validations (including any agent-based validations specified in the task).
  - **⚠️ MANDATORY: Mark the task as completed:**
    - **UPDATE this README task list `[ ] → [x]`** (CRITICAL!)
    - **UPDATE the Plan Status section** (completed count)
    - **UPDATE the task file's completion / log section**
  - Commit changes before moving to the next task.
- Stop and log any blocking issue or failing validation.

> **IMPORTANT:** Failing to mark tasks as completed will break resume functionality and cause repeated work!

## 6. Skills & Agents Used in This Plan

List relevant skills and agents referenced by tasks in this plan:

| Task | Skill/Agent | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Task 1 | `/add-page` skill | Page creation procedure |
| Task 2 | `i18n-guardian` agent | Bilingual validation |

> See the full catalog at `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`

## 7. Plan Status / Notes

- Current status:
  - Example: "In progress, Task 2"
- Relevant notes or decisions that affect the whole plan.

## 8. Quick Reference

**Need prompts for this plan?** See [PROMPTS.md](./PROMPTS.md) for ready-to-use copy-paste prompts to execute, resume, or check this plan.
```

---

## 5. Task File Structure (`N.task_{task_title}.md`)

Each task file is a **self-contained deep-work prompt** for a single task.
The agent must be able to read **only this file**, understand exactly what to do, and execute it to completion.

### 5.1. Required sections

Each `N.task_{task_title}.md` must have:

1. **Title**
2. **Context**
3. **Goal**
4. **Instructions**
5. **Acceptance Criteria**
6. **Validation**
7. **Execution Checklist (step-by-step)**
8. **Completion & Log (filled by the agent)**

### 5.2. Example template

````markdown
# Task {N}: {Task Title}

## 1. Context

Explain clearly:

- Which part of the codebase this affects.
- Where the relevant files are.
- Any existing patterns or conventions to follow.
- Links or references to design docs if needed.

## 2. Goal

A concise description of what this task must achieve.

Example:

- "Add a BlogCategories component to display post categories."
- "Add pagination to the projects section on the homepage."

## 3. Instructions

Detailed, actionable instructions for this **single** task.

Guidelines:

- Specify directories and filenames.
- Mention patterns to reuse or avoid.
- Provide detailed prompts if necessary.
- Clarify what _not_ to change, if important.

Example:

- Create a new component at `src/components/blog/BlogCategories.svelte`.
- Follow the component patterns defined in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Use TypeScript with type annotations for props.
- Support dark mode with Tailwind's `dark:` variant.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

Explicit conditions for considering this task **done**.

Examples:

- All required functionality is implemented.
- Code matches the patterns in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- No TypeScript errors (`npm run astro:check` passes).
- Biome checks pass (`npm run biome:check`).
- Build succeeds (`npm run build`).
- Dark mode is supported in UI components.
- Naming and structure follow existing conventions in `docs/STANDARDS.md`.

## 5. Validation

Commands that **must be executed and pass** before marking the task as completed.

Example:

```bash
# Run code quality checks
npm run biome:check        # Lint and format check
npm run astro:check        # TypeScript checking
npm run build              # Verify production build works
```

If any of these fail, the agent must **stop, log the issue, and not mark the task as complete**.

**Note:** Testing is not configured in this project. When tests are added, include `npm run test` in validation.

## 6. Execution Checklist

The agent must follow these steps sequentially:

- [ ] 1. Read this task file fully and understand the goal and constraints.
- [ ] 2. Inspect the current implementation / related files.
- [ ] 3. Implement the required changes.
- [ ] 4. Run the validation commands listed above.
- [ ] 5. Review the diff and ensure it matches acceptance criteria.
- [ ] 6. Update the plan README to mark this task as `[x]` in the Task List.
- [ ] 7. Commit the changes with a clear commit message.
- [ ] 8. Update the Log section below.

## 7. Completion & Log (filled by the agent)

The agent must append a short log here when the task is done (or blocked):

- **Status:** (completed / blocked / failed validation)
- **Timestamp:**
- **Summary of work:**
- **Files changed:**
- **Validation results:**
- **Notes / follow-ups:**
````

---

## 6. Agent Execution Rules (Critical Behavior)

When an agent is instructed to use this system, it must obey:

1. **Single-task focus**
   - Only work on **one task file** at a time.
   - Ignore other tasks until the current one is fully completed or blocked.

2. **Strict order**
   - Always process the **first unchecked** task in the plan README (`[ ]`).
   - Once completed, mark it `[x]` and move to the next.

3. **Validation required**
   - Never mark a task as completed without running and considering the validations defined in the task file.

4. **Logging & commits**
   - Always update the task's log.
   - Always commit work before moving on.

5. **Stop on failure**
   - If a validation fails or something is unclear, stop and log.
   - Do not continue blindly.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Task Completion Tracking (MANDATORY)

> **THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM**

### Why This Matters

The plan README's task list (`[ ]` / `[x]`) is the **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for plan progress. Without proper task marking:

- Interrupted sessions cannot resume correctly
- Progress is lost and tasks may be repeated
- Plan status becomes unreliable
- Multi-day executions become impossible to track

### MANDATORY Actions After Each Task

**IMMEDIATELY after completing EACH task, the agent MUST:**

1. **Update the plan README.md** - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed task
2. **Update the Plan Status table** - Update the phase status and completed count
3. **Update the task file's Completion & Log section** - Record status, timestamp, and summary

### Example: Before and After

**BEFORE completing Task 3:**

```markdown
## Task List

- [x] Task 1: Setup
- [x] Task 2: Implementation
- [ ] Task 3: Testing ← Currently working on
- [ ] Task 4: Documentation

## Plan Status

**Completed**: 2/4
```

**AFTER completing Task 3:**

```markdown
## Task List

- [x] Task 1: Setup
- [x] Task 2: Implementation
- [x] Task 3: Testing ← Just completed, MUST mark!
- [ ] Task 4: Documentation

## Plan Status

**Completed**: 3/4
```

### Verification Checklist (Run After Each Task)

Before moving to the next task, verify:

- [ ] ✅ Plan README task is marked `[x]`
- [ ] ✅ Plan Status count is updated (e.g., "3/25")
- [ ] ✅ Task file Completion & Log section is filled
- [ ] ✅ Changes are committed

### Consequences of Not Marking Tasks

❌ **If tasks are NOT marked as completed:**

- Resume operations will REDO already-completed work
- Time and resources will be wasted
- The plan becomes unreliable and confusing
- Long-running plans become impossible to manage

✅ **If tasks ARE properly marked:**

- Seamless resume after interruptions
- Clear progress visibility at all times
- Reliable multi-day/multi-session execution
- Accurate status reporting

## 7. How to Instruct an Agent to Generate a New Plan

When you want Cursor, Claude, or another agent to **generate a new deep-work plan**, you can say:

> **Prompt to the agent:**
>
> - Create the folder structure under `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/` if it does not exist:
>   - `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/README.md`
>   - `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/GUIDE_TO_CREATE_AGENT_DEEP_WORK_PLANS.md` (this guide)
>   - `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/` (git-ignored)
> - Then, create a new plan folder:
>   - `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PLAN_{plan_title}/`
> - Inside that plan folder:
>   - Create `README.md` describing:
>     - The overall goal
>     - Context
>     - Global guidelines
>     - A Task List with `[ ]` items and links to each `N.task_*.md` file
>     - Execution rules for the agent
>     - Skills & Agents used in this plan (consult `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`)
>     - Reference to PROMPTS.md for ready-to-use prompts
>   - Create `PROMPTS.md` with ready-to-use prompts for this plan:
>     - Use the template at `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PROMPTS_TEMPLATE.md`
>     - Replace `{PLAN_NAME}` with the actual plan name
>     - Include prompts for: execute, resume, resume with status, check status, modify
>   - For each task in the Task List:
>     - Create a `N.task_{task_title}.md` file following the task template defined in `GUIDE_TO_CREATE_AGENT_DEEP_WORK_PLANS.md`.
>     - Check `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md` for relevant skills/agents to reference in each task.
>     - Ensure each task file has:
>       - Context
>       - Goal
>       - Instructions (referencing relevant skill files when applicable)
>       - Acceptance Criteria
>       - Validation commands (including agent-based validation when applicable)
>       - Execution checklist
>       - Completion & Log section
> - Make sure all tasks are:
>   - Atomic (one clear objective)
>   - Ordered
>   - Written so an agent can complete each one independently and with high quality.

---

## 8. How to Instruct an Agent to Execute a Plan

When a plan is ready and you want an agent to **run it**, say:

> **Execution prompt to the agent:**
>
> - Use `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PLAN_{plan_title}/README.md` as your source of truth.
> - Follow these rules:
>   - Work on **one task at a time**.
>   - Always pick the **first unchecked `[ ]` task** in the Task List.
>   - Open the corresponding `N.task_*.md` file and follow its instructions in full.
>   - Run all validation commands specified in the task file.
>   - Only when the task meets all acceptance criteria:
>     - Mark it as `[x]` in the plan README Task List.
>     - Update the task file's Completion & Log section.
>     - Commit the changes.
>   - Then move to the next `[ ]` task and repeat.
>   - If a validation fails or something is unclear, stop, log in the task file, and do not mark the task as completed.

---

## 9. How to Resume an Interrupted Plan (CRITICAL)

### 9.1. When to Resume

Plans may be interrupted due to:

- **Internet connection loss** during execution
- **IDE/editor crashes** (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
- **Agent hitting token/context limits** mid-execution
- **Intentional breaks** (overnight pauses, scheduled stops)
- **System shutdowns** or unexpected errors

The resume functionality ensures work can continue **exactly where it left off** without duplicating completed tasks.

### 9.2. Resume Prompt Template

When a plan is interrupted and you want to resume execution, use this prompt:

> **Resume prompt to the agent:**
>
> RESUME the deep work plan at: `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PLAN_{plan_title}/README.md`
>
> **Resume Instructions:**
>
> 1. **Read the plan README** to understand the overall objective
> 2. **Check the task list** - identify which tasks are marked `[x]` (completed) and which are `[ ]` (pending)
> 3. **Find the FIRST unchecked `[ ]` task** - this is your resumption point
> 4. **BEFORE starting work on that task:**
>    - Review the task file completely (`N.task_{task_title}.md`)
>    - Check if any work was already started:
>      - Run: `git status` (are there uncommitted changes?)
>      - Run: `git diff` (what was changed since last commit?)
>      - Run: `git log --oneline -10` (what are recent commits?)
>    - Review the task's **Completion & Log** section for any notes from the previous session
>    - If work was partially done, assess what remains to complete it
> 5. **Continue execution** from that task following normal execution rules:
>    - Complete the current task
>    - Run all validation commands
>    - Update the task's Completion & Log section
>    - Mark as `[x]` in the plan README
>    - Commit changes
>    - Move to next `[ ]` task
> 6. **NEVER redo completed `[x]` tasks**
> 7. **NEVER skip `[ ]` tasks**
>
> **Context awareness:**
>
> - Review recent git commits to understand what was accomplished
> - Check for uncommitted changes that indicate partial work
> - Read task completion logs for any notes or blockers from previous session
>
> Begin resuming now. First report:
>
> - Which tasks are already completed `[x]`
> - Which task you're resuming from `[ ]`
> - Any uncommitted work or partial progress found
> - Your plan for completing the current task

### 9.3. Critical Resume Rules

**The agent MUST follow these rules when resuming:**

1. **Verify completion status**
   - Trust the plan README's task list (`[x]` vs `[ ]`)
   - Cross-check with git commits for confirmation
   - Never assume - always verify current state

2. **Assess partial work**
   - If `git status` shows uncommitted changes, review them carefully
   - If changes align with current task, incorporate and complete
   - If changes are unrelated or unclear, seek clarification

3. **Read completion logs**
   - Previous session may have left notes in task's Completion & Log section
   - Look for blockers, issues, or follow-up items
   - Use this context to inform current work

4. **Never duplicate work**
   - If a task is marked `[x]`, it's done - move on
   - Don't re-implement completed functionality
   - Trust the previous session's work unless validation fails

5. **Continue strict order**
   - Resume from first `[ ]` task
   - Complete it fully before moving to next
   - Maintain sequential execution

### 9.4. Example Resume Scenarios

**Scenario A: Clean interruption (all work committed)**

```text
Plan status:
- Task 1: [x] Completed, committed
- Task 2: [x] Completed, committed
- Task 3: [ ] Not started
- Task 4: [ ] Not started

Resume action:
→ Start work on Task 3
→ Follow task 3's instructions completely
→ No partial work to review
```

**Scenario B: Interruption mid-task (uncommitted changes)**

```text
Plan status:
- Task 1: [x] Completed, committed
- Task 2: [x] Completed, committed
- Task 3: [ ] In progress (git diff shows changes)
- Task 4: [ ] Not started

Resume action:
→ Review uncommitted changes (git diff)
→ Assess if changes are valid partial progress
→ Continue completing Task 3
→ Run validations, update logs, commit
→ Move to Task 4
```

**Scenario C: Interruption with blocker logged**

```text
Plan status:
- Task 1: [x] Completed, committed
- Task 2: [ ] Blocked (log says: "validation failed - coverage at 45%, need 50%")
- Task 3: [ ] Not started

Resume action:
→ Read Task 2's Completion & Log
→ Understand the blocker (coverage issue)
→ Fix the validation failure
→ Re-run validations
→ If pass: mark [x], commit, move to Task 3
→ If still fail: log again, stop, request help
```

### 9.5. Resume Checklist for Agents

When resuming a plan, the agent should:

- [ ] 1. Read plan README completely
- [ ] 2. Identify completed `[x]` vs pending `[ ]` tasks
- [ ] 3. Find first `[ ]` task (resumption point)
- [ ] 4. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted work
- [ ] 5. Run `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits
- [ ] 6. Read current task's Completion & Log for notes
- [ ] 7. Assess partial work if any
- [ ] 8. Report resumption status to user
- [ ] 9. Continue execution following normal rules
- [ ] 10. Never skip or duplicate tasks

---

## 10. Cleanup and Lifecycle

- Plan folders under `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/` are **temporary**.
- After a plan is fully executed and merged:
  - The folder may be archived or deleted.
  - Any important learnings should be summarized in a more permanent doc if needed.
- The main repo remains clean and lightweight.

---

## 11. Skills & Agents Integration (MANDATORY)

When creating deep work plans, the plan generator MUST consult the project's available Skills and Agents to produce higher-quality, more consistent plans.

### Why This Matters

- Skills contain battle-tested, step-by-step procedures for common tasks
- Agents provide specialized validation checklists and review expertise
- Referencing them in task files ensures the executor follows proven procedures instead of improvising instructions from scratch
- This produces more consistent, higher-quality results across all plans

### Where to Find Skills & Agents

Before creating any plan, the generator MUST read:

1. **Skills catalog:** `.claude/docs/skills_agents_catalog.md`
   - Lists all available skills with names, tiers, and descriptions
2. **Individual skill files:** `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
   - Contains detailed step-by-step procedures, guardrails, and validation
3. **Agent files:** `.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md`
   - Contains specialized checklists, workflows, and validation criteria

### How to Integrate Skills into Task Files

When writing a task file (`N.task_*.md`), the plan generator MUST:

1. **Check if a relevant skill exists** for the task's objective
   - Example: Task is "Create a new page" → use `/add-page` skill
   - Example: Task is "Fix linting errors" → use `/fix-lint` skill
   - Example: Task is "Create a blog post" → use `/add-blog-post` skill
   - Example: Task is "Synchronize translations" → use `/translate-sync` skill

2. **If a matching skill exists, reference it in the task instructions:**

   ````markdown
   ## 3. Instructions

   Follow the procedure defined in the skill file:
   **Skill:** `/skill-name` → `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`

   Read the skill file and follow its steps. Additionally:
   - [Any task-specific additions or overrides]
   - [Context specific to this plan]
   ````

3. **If no matching skill exists, write instructions normally** (as described in section 5 of this guide)

4. **For validation steps, check if a relevant agent exists:**
   - Task involves code changes → add `reviewer` agent validation
   - Task involves translation or bilingual content → add `i18n-guardian` agent validation
   - Task involves security-sensitive changes → add `security-auditor` agent validation

   ````markdown
   ## 5. Validation

   Standard validations:
   ```bash
   npm run biome:check
   npm run astro:check
   npm run build
   ```

   Agent-based validation:
   - Follow the checklist in `.claude/agents/{agent-name}.md` section "Audit Checklist"
     to verify {specific concern}
   ````

5. **Always prefer skill procedures over ad-hoc instructions** when a skill covers the task's objective, even partially. The skill has been tested and refined; ad-hoc instructions have not.

### How to Reference Skills & Agents in Plan README

The plan's `README.md` should include a section listing which skills and agents are relevant to the plan:

```markdown
## Skills & Agents Used in This Plan

| Task | Skill/Agent | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Task 1 | `/add-page` skill | Page creation procedure |
| Task 2 | `/translate-sync` skill | Translation synchronization |
| Task 3 | `i18n-guardian` agent | Bilingual validation |
| Task 5 | `reviewer` agent | Code quality validation |

### Keeping the Registry Updated

**CRITICAL:** The skills/agents catalog MUST be kept up to date.

- When a plan creates new skills or agents, update the catalog immediately
- When a skill or agent is deprecated, remove it from the catalog
- The catalog is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for what's available
- If the catalog is outdated, plans will reference non-existent procedures or miss available ones

## 12. Summary

This guide defines how an agent should:

- Create deep-work plans under `.agent_commands/agent_deep_work_plans/results/plans/PLAN_{plan_title}/`
- Split work into ordered, single-focus task files
- Execute tasks sequentially, with strong validation and logging
- Resume interrupted plans without duplicating work
- Keep everything temporary and isolated from the main repository
- Leverage existing skills and agents for higher-quality, more consistent task instructions and validation

Use this as the **authoritative specification** whenever an agent is asked to:

- Generate a new plan
- Prepare detailed per-task prompts
- Run long, focused, multi-task deep-work sessions
- Resume interrupted execution safely and efficiently
