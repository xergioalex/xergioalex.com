# Upgrade Minor Versions Only

## Prompt

```
Upgrade only minor and patch versions of all project dependencies following `.agent_commands/agent_library_upgrades/GUIDE.md`. Skip all major upgrades.

Process:
1. Run `ncu` to discover available upgrades
2. Filter to only minor/patch upgrades (exclude major version bumps)
3. Update `package.json` with new versions using `ncu -u --target minor`
4. Execute `npm install` to update lock file and install packages
5. If any package fails, rollback that package and retry (max 3 attempts)
6. Run validation (`codecheck`) after successful upgrade
7. Generate a report listing:
   - All successfully upgraded packages (old → new versions)
   - Any failed packages with error details
   - List of major upgrades that were skipped (for reference)

Expected outcome:
- Only minor/patch upgrades applied
- Major upgrades skipped (listed in report for future consideration)
- Comprehensive report of changes
- All validation checks passing
```
