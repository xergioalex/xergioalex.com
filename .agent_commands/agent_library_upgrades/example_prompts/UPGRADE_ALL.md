# Upgrade All Packages

## Prompt

```
Upgrade all project dependencies following the system at `.agent_commands/agent_library_upgrades/GUIDE.md`.

Process:
1. Run `ncu` to discover available upgrades
2. Categorize upgrades as minor (patch/minor) or major
3. Prioritize minor upgrades first
4. Ask me for approval before upgrading major versions
5. Update `package.json` with new versions using `ncu -u`
6. Execute `npm install` to update lock file and install packages
7. If any package fails, rollback that package and retry (max 3 attempts)
8. Run validation (`codecheck`) after successful upgrade
9. Generate a comprehensive report with:
   - List of successfully upgraded packages (old → new versions)
   - List of failed packages (if any) with error details
   - Recommendations for next steps

Expected outcome:
- All minor upgrades applied automatically
- Major upgrades applied only with my approval
- Comprehensive report of all changes
- All validation checks passing
```
