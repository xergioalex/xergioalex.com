# Skill: PR Review Lite

## Objective

Perform a quick, checklist-based review of a pull request focusing on style issues, obvious bugs, and missing test coverage. This is a lightweight review, not a deep architectural analysis.

## Non-Goals

- Does NOT perform deep architectural review
- Does NOT rewrite code
- Does NOT make changes to the PR
- Does NOT review security-sensitive changes in depth
- Does NOT review database migrations

## Tier Classification

**Tier: 1** - Light/Cheap

**Reasoning:** Checklist-based review with pattern matching, no complex reasoning required. Read-only operation with no code changes.

## Inputs

### Required Parameters

- `$PR_FILES`: List of files changed in the PR (or PR URL/number)

### Optional Parameters

- `$FOCUS`: Specific areas to focus on (default: all)

## Prerequisites

- [ ] PR diff is accessible

## Steps

### Step 1: Read the PR

- Read the diff for each file
- Note the scope of changes

### Step 2: Run Checklist

Go through each item:

**Style & Formatting:**

- [ ] Follows naming conventions
- [ ] No debug code left (console.log, print)
- [ ] No commented-out code

**Code Quality:**

- [ ] No obvious bugs
- [ ] No null/undefined issues
- [ ] Error handling present
- [ ] No hardcoded values that should be config

**Tests:**

- [ ] Tests exist for new code
- [ ] Tests are meaningful (not just coverage)
- [ ] Edge cases considered

**Documentation:**
